<p>I haven&#8217;t written in here in awhile, so what else is new? That&#8217;s both a question to events happening in my life, and a rhetorical statement to the fact that I&#8217;m a terrible caretaker of this blog.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m not really going to answer those questions, but I suppose you could say I had a bout of writer&#8217;s block. They say one of the best cures to the block is to simply force yourself to write, that waiting for inspiration is what paralyzes most writers in the first place. It&#8217;s easier said than done, really. I suppose it&#8217;s like trying to quit an addiction, or simply forcing yourself into an unknown, into a place that you can&#8217;t control, and why wouldn&#8217;t anyone be afraid of that? We&#8217;ve all been bred since day one to be able to set goals and resolutions for ourselves, that we&#8217;re all supposed to be following some sort of a plan, or have some sort of a plan. Writing freely without an objective in mind seems to almost be the anti-thesis of trained life.</p>
<p>Yet here we are, words flowing freely, not thinking about the consequences to these words. Given that as always, I am rather cryptic as to what I&#8217;m <em>really</em> thinking in my heart, and still have some level of self-censorship, it does feel right to type in here again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to pay my hosting fees again, and I am still seriously contemplating if I should upkeep this piece of digital real estate at all, given that I&#8217;ve learned the hard way that maintaining a blog and website on your own is a fair amount of work, especially with keeping up to date with the updates (hurhur, see what I did there?) and making sure that things are still relevant. Also, with a schedule and escapes into computer games, I just don&#8217;t find the same urgency to write as I once did. It&#8217;s easier to do and let actions speak louder than words. Perhaps the pressure is also off, because since I&#8217;m a teacher, I don&#8217;t really have an obligation to blog anymore.</p>
<p>But I started writing without an obligation. I started writing to be a part of something, and to be able to express myself on the Internet. I got my own space because I wanted to own my identity, rather than share it with a service, and that narcissistic part of me still exists. I think I&#8217;ll continue with hosting my own space, as a sort of testament that I should still exist in this digital form, an avatar to roam the Net.</p>
<p>Another thing that prevented me from writing in here, is the limitation I have with my lifestreaming service on the main domain. It messes up when I don&#8217;t insert in image in each post, and I&#8217;ve been torn to find proper images because it involves having me to upload pictures to flickr and then pulling the code, and it takes too much effort to find the right images (especially if you&#8217;re a visual person like me). I created placeholders of course, but it would involve me needing to find the code over and over again. Finally, I realised I just need to save the code somewhere and just reuse it, and hopefully I can just journal effortlessly like I did when I first started.</p>
<p>I wonder why it always comes back to the beginning. It seems to pure and unbridled, when I started blogging in the beginning. I was a nobody and it felt natural to express everything down in words. I suppose things change when I had to do PR and that social media engagement drivel, and certain things were expected of me. I hate expectations, especially when they&#8217;re expected of me. I don&#8217;t think I take to them well, and I tend to shut down in the face of challenge. It sounds really wussy, but it&#8217;s easier to solve somebody else&#8217;s problem rather than your own.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m going to stop here for now before I get carried away. I need to meet my family for dinner, but if things turn out the way I want them to, maybe I&#8217;ll be writing in here more often. Maybe this is a first step again, me re-learning everything I learned and unlearned. Maybe I&#8217;ll remember who I am, and wouldn&#8217;t that be a treat? Again, I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s reading and listening, but if you are, thank you for letting me share all that. </p>

<p>I wish I knew how it was all going to turn out. </p>
<p>I may not know much about brain physiology, but it seems that it is common knowledge that our frontal lobes are not fully developed in our youth, and according to a friend of mine, the frontal lobes fully develop in adults at around the age of twenty-five. </p>
<p>Long story short, the frontal lobes lean toward the executive decision making portions of our thinking. It is able to understand the ramifications of our choices, it is able to see into the short and long term consequences of any of the actions we choose to take. They explains to a degree, why youths tend to live in the moment and not fully appreciate the consequences of their actions. I was like that once, and I think I&#8217;ve indulged a little too much of my under-developed frontal lobe back in the day. </p>
<p>It might also explain some of the paralysis that I face today, when it comes to completing certain tasks. There are so many things that I want to do, that I know I have to do, and there are occasions when I just don&#8217;t want to do anything. Perhaps my brain has now developed a tad more than when I was younger, so I can appreciate the consequences of my actions and inactions, yet with the limited amount of time all humans face on earth, the logical conclusion is to either not try so hard, or go out with guns blazing. </p>
<p>Sadly, maybe I choose inactivity a little too often. Oh, the irony of having to choose to do nothing, like it was the most difficult decision to come upon us.</p>
<p>Alas, there are just so many things to consume, rather than create. There are so many books to read, TV shows and movies to watch, games to play, food to eat, clothes to wear, homes to decorate.. etc.. We live in a world of abundance, so much so that it has almost made us too lazy to create anymore.</p>
<p>I talk of recording the songs I&#8217;ve written, or perhaps doing more visual work, electronic music or even writing a novel, but I&#8217;ve done none of that in all the time that I have after work. I merely consume more information, but it doesn&#8217;t have any proper utilisation or output. It almost sickens me that I&#8217;m living this opulent lifestyle with the wealth of information that we have, that I&#8217;m just not getting fat physically, but mentally as well.</p>
<p>A slow plodding whale of pop culture facts and opinions. And the closest thing I have to output is this sordid blog that I maintain. Even that itself is a chore sometimes. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s been too long since I&#8217;ve typed in here. I guess I&#8217;ve been rather afraid of this blank space. Most days I come home tired, uninspired, and just escape into my little bubble of video games, books, TV or the random discovery of the Net. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the healthiest of lives, since there&#8217;s very little application of self in such activity. There&#8217;s a lot of passive learning that goes on, and you get to fill your head with all sorts of knowledge and ideas, but then they don&#8217;t go anywhere else, and they just stay inside me, and I wander this world like it&#8217;s one big inside joke.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want it to be this way, I&#8217;d like to change certain things about myself. I feel like I&#8217;m in a dream, and I want out. I don&#8217;t want to just exist inside my head, or live by myself with all these ideas, but they don&#8217;t translate themselves into the physical realm. </p>
<p>Then again, why is the physical realm, the one that seems to matter the most? One reason, is that it&#8217;s the only realm where we begin communicating with other beings. We understand and the stimulus comes from external sources. There&#8217;s an unhealthy imbalance of internalization on my part, so it only makes sense to balance it with some form of externalization. Perhaps when the two are balanced, we, as physical, intellectual and spiritual creatures,  are then able to walk the thin veil, the void of existence where the two meet, and where nothing exists. Perhaps then, we will finally bring balance to the paradox of our cosmic importance. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not smoking up by the way, but the words just came out by themselves, guided by a motivation that I can scarce explain if it was from me, or some other force. But it doesn&#8217;t matter. I like the way they filled the blank, white space that plagues every blogging interface, and surely, that counts for something.</p>
<p>Perhaps, just as a signpost of sorts, I would like to mark down things that I would like to see myself doing in the near-sighted future. They&#8217;re not necessarily goals as much as they are whims and fancies.</p>
<p>1. Get better on bass and music in general<br />
2. Learn how to create electronic music<br />
3. Write a 5 song EP<br />
4. Start a music label / community<br />
5. Write a novel<br />
6. Blog consistently<br />
7. Clean my room<br />
8. Install the network drives that I bought a month ago<br />
9. Lose weight<br />
10. Be physically fitter and healthier</p>
<p>Ten&#8217;s always a healthy number isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just finished reading George R.R. Martin&#8217;s <em>&#8220;A Game of Thrones&#8221;</em>, and it was a thoroughly splendid read! I&#8217;m delighted that I had decided to get the box set that includes the three other books in the series so far.</p>
<p>Right now, the only things that ring true in my brain are the sigils of each house, the locations in relations to Westeros, and the names of the great Houses in the story. Starks, Lannisters, Tullys, Arryns, Targaryns.. etc</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how it always gets with me, the moment I attach myself to the lore that someone else has created. It&#8217;s a powerful manifestation of words that almost make me believe, or want to believe that such a world exists. It&#8217;s a futile exercise in escapism, but for those few moments that you&#8217;ve escaped, the cares and wants of the world seem to be left at the door when you enter the other realm.</p>
<p>I fear that one day, I will lock myself into an alternate reality and not find it in my best interest to step out from the veil again.</p>
<p>Back in the real world, I&#8217;ve been afflicted with some sort of ear infection, that caused my ears to itch and bleed for about a week. Last Sunday was the worst, when my left ear was in extreme pain, almost like a pressure building up from inside the ear and wanting to burst forth from a dam, yet.. for an inexplicable reason, the dam held, and my nerves were on fire. Some paracetamol did help relieve the pain.</p>
<p>Now, it feels like my left ear is plugged up. I had feared that my eardrums had ruptured, but I still have my hearing, so I quickly ruled the possibility out. I do fear that I&#8217;ll lose my sense of hearing though. I mean, I need it for music, and enjoying music, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m genius enough to write masterpieces as Beethoven did. It would be incredibly anti climatic as well, to fall from grace in such a manner.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Why did you stop enjoying music, Brian?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Twas an infection in the ear that made my sense of hearing leave my being.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sucks.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I can almost see it now.</p>
<p>Well, hopefully, now that I&#8217;ve awoken from my stupor of reading stories, hopefully I shall be more productive with my time, and do more creative things, and not just consume, like a swarm of locusts. </p>

<p>For reasons that I can&#8217;t clearly articulate right now, I&#8217;ve always been enamoured by this man-machine hybrid toward graphic design. I&#8217;m neither a designer, nor a programmer. And I already express myself fairly creatively through writing and music. Why then, the interest to pick up a new skill set? Perhaps it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve always found some sort of <em>visual aesthetic</em> missing from my repertoire. I think it&#8217;s a 21st century condition, that we&#8217;re constantly seeking mixed-media experiences. Well, I know I am, because of such a varied spectrum of media that I consume, it only makes sense that in the comprehension and synthesis stages of learning, I try to express myself across the disciplines of <em>text, audio, visual, data. </em></p>
<p>I know I&#8217;ll probably never be an expert in any, but I&#8217;d like to try. It could mean that I will be less devoted to certain things, but I think at my age, when we&#8217;re so told to start building our foundations to be an expert in something, we also should not lose the wide-eyed wonderment toward the beauty (and harshness) of this world&#8217;s reality. So I may only have the skill of a chicken scratching on walls, but hey.. it&#8217;d be nice to have a wide palette of colours, and perhaps different claws to scratch with.</p>
<p>I just thought you&#8217;d like to know if you&#8217;re still reading this. </p>

<em>&#8220;apocalyptia and croissants &#8211; breakfast of champions&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I had the weirdest dream last night.</p>
<p>I dreamt I went  to Paris (I&#8217;ve never been), and it was some sort of quasi family holiday, but we were all going at different intervals. For some reason, I was the first one to leave, and that I would meet my sister somewhere in Paris. However, during the flight there, I&#8217;d forgotten, when and where I was supposed to meet my sister, and I quite literally panicked on the plane. </p>
<p>Soon enough the plane landed, and I was shuffled out of the airport. Apparently I was simply walking around the streets of some suburban looking place, but in the horizon, I could always seen the Eiffel Tower. Light was fading fast, and for some odd reason, I knew I had to find shelter before it got dark (a very recurring theme in survival horror). Now, as it slowly turned to dusk, there was a cold wind blowing that constantly got windier and windier. This was probably the most iconic moment in my dream, as I had never felt a physical sensation quite as strongly as in this dream.</p>
<p>There were a few time skips here and there, but somehow, I found myself in a little cottage of sorts to spend the night. There were caretakers in the cottage, and they were making some sort of casseroled whole chicken and beef stew (in separate pots). I was waiting longingly for my food, when suddenly, I almost remembered that I had to meet my sister somewhere (remember at this time, I&#8217;d actually &#8220;forgotten&#8221; when and where I was supposed to meet her.</p>
<p>So now, time was running out, and I found a fix-geared bicycle of sorts, and I was cycling all over this Parisian neighbourhood, desperately looking for my sister, or rather, cycling as fast as I could to get to a predetermined place that I seemed to know by instinct, and wasn&#8217;t part of my conscious thought. </p>
<p>Policemen were chasing me, and angry suburban dwellers were shouting at me. And then the handlebars of my bicycle suddenly became some sort of elastic band, and I could steer my bicycle by also stretching the handlebars toward me. Weird, I know.</p>
<p>And then, before I knew it, there my sister was, and we were reunited. We made our way back to the cottage, and there my parents were, having just gotten of their flight, and we were about to enjoy a wonderful casserole meal when my alarm rang.</p>
<p>It was a rather vivid dream, and for some reason, one of the best things I&#8217;ve dreamt about in awhile. </p>

<em>&#8220;Scatach, scratch, scratch your life away.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It has been far too long since I&#8217;ve typed in here. I&#8217;ve just been so busy with work and life events that I haven&#8217;t found the time to load the familiar blogging interface that has allowed me to chronicle the happenings, ins and outs of my thoughts and feelings. No big loss really, I think I&#8217;ve lost an audience, but still it brings comfort when I journal a portion of my ongoing journey. </p>
<p>The main thing I would like to get off my chest, is how I&#8217;m thinking of finishing my contract with the Ministry of Education as a teacher, and move on to something else. It&#8217;s been a grand journey, and I&#8217;ve accomplished most of the things I&#8217;d set out for myself to do in that, I could work in an organisation, I could be hardworking, and that I could contribute back to society. One thing I hadn&#8217;t planned on though, was that I don&#8217;t exactly do a very good job managing a classroom. I&#8217;m not a taskmaster in that I don&#8217;t think I set enough rules in place to create a conducive environment for teaching. I don&#8217;t believe my lessons are boring or that I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m teaching, but I&#8217;m just not the right fit for an organisation that requires me to have a particular management style. I suppose I could change, but in this regard, I won&#8217;t, not when there are still options and I know much more clearly, what I want for myself in this life. To which I would tell my current employers, don&#8217;t take it personally, it&#8217;s just business. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a ball of a time, and I wouldn&#8217;t trade this experience for anything else. I&#8217;m really glad I took the step and spent time working the trenches, but I believe it&#8217;s time to stop pleasing other people (societal expectations and would-be futures) and start to do something for myself, and perhaps, finally be myself with the confidence that I&#8217;ve been lacking.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s a major update. Other things that I&#8217;ve been busy with are the usual things that have always kept me busy. Music, writing, being a friend, being a son and also, being a paying customer to the Pigeonhole, a nice art-space cafe that my friends Ave &#038; Rayner have set up. Check out the news and future happenings at this link. -> <a href="http://the-pigeonhole.tumblr.com" target="_blank" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/the-pigeonhole.tumblr.com?referer=');">here</a>. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve really been taken by the place. It really helps that I&#8217;m friends with the owners, and that I can perhaps almost live vicariously through their plunge as cafe proprietors. But I&#8217;ve had so much fun meeting new people, friends, taking part in PowerPoint KTVs and Open Mic sessions. It&#8217;s been a wonderful respite to my otherwise confined working environment of mass produced education for the public. It&#8217;s a great feeling to express yourself creatively, and that&#8217;s what I crave for, and what I want to be around in my next job. Copywriting? Working in the arts or something music related? Yes, these are all questions that are easier to answer now that I have the blessing of retrospect.</p>
<p>The big lesson I&#8217;m taking away from the past four months, is that somethings, I just have to take a plunge, feet first into the chill waters and hope to God that I can swim against the current. Pray that He gives us the strength to swim back to shore and not be swept away by the undertow. But take a first step. Don&#8217;t hold back.</p>

<em>&#8220;black was a much better colour for doctors back in the day.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Catharsis was one of the main reasons I&#8217;ve maintained a blog. In recent times, I&#8217;d stopped coming into this space to type down my thoughts and feelings, because to a certain degree, it seemed unbecoming for a professional to come into his personal space and air his disappointments, frustrations, indecision and insecurity.</p>
<p>Perhaps it started back when I had first become a communications consultant. When it comes to communications, even in the spirit of being transparent, one still has to show a posture of strength, control and confidence. So maybe I&#8217;m throwing my own advice out of the window when I have to renew a vigor in writing, by coming back to this space with a melancholic, and fidgety spirit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid of the education system failing you. I&#8217;m afraid of the educator failing you. But I&#8217;m certain that education will not fail you. The system and teacher are man-made, and as such.. are perfect constructs for being fallible. The ideal of education however, simply remains an ideal, and is perhaps in a higher order above man, perhaps in the realm of nature and universal truths. But I don&#8217;t think knowledge and wisdom will ever be detrimental to the being of man or the society which she serves. </p>
<p>Maybe it is in this ideal that I can find some comfort in my shortfalls. That I am tired, from trying to plan lessons for Wednesday and Thursday, trying to finish marking and keying in all the results of my students for the termly progress report for three different subjects by Thursday. The task seems insurmountable when I have more lesson preparation before the week ends, a spelling bee contest to plan by next week, one e-learning package to finalise and upload by this Thursday, and another by Friday. Staying on top of two events that will be happening in late March and early April, a camp to go for in the middle of March, as well as balance my remedial training with the army that takes me away every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday for about 3 hours a time. Time that could have been spent at work.</p>
<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a slight tinge of guilt, because I could have forgone my social obligations for the past two weeks and been a bit more on top of things, but again, I placed too much confidence in my ability, and less caution to my weaknesses and trappings. </p>
<p>But if there is a sliver of hope, it is that if I survive this week, the next two weeks will be much quieter, and I can really plan for the next quarter that starts on the 21st of March. If my nerves breathe normal, and I suck it in till the end of the week, I could be a very happy person starting this weekend. </p>
<p>If these things don&#8217;t give me aneurysm first.</p>

<p>Allow me to speak plainly in here.</p>
<p>I am tired and terrified. </p>
<p>Tired because I feel as if I have been working non-stop since the year started. Although I started teaching in September last year, it was only at the start of this year that I was given my own classes, and the whole responsibility of imparting to them the syllabus, the guidance and the example of which to perhaps get through or <em>survive</em> Secondary education.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired because whatever respite I have, seems to involve playing music, having rehearsals, going for Remedial Training with the army or trying to finish my work. Even when I&#8217;m supposed to be able to look forward to the one-week vacation that comes in mid-march, I have to go back into an army camp, so that I may perform my duty toward my country in what is known as the annual In-Camp Training.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired because I&#8217;m constantly thinking and worrying about work. Maybe I&#8217;m also just constantly worrying. Worrying about whether this will be the career I settle in because slowly, I find myself having to conform to the nature of the civil service, just so I can prove my worth toward the organisation. It is a rigid process and I am a fluid person. I know I wanted stability, but it almost seems as if the walls are closing in. Maybe I&#8217;m tired because I feel as if I want to go one direction in terms of personal development, and another when it comes to professional development. It&#8217;s as if, the two don&#8217;t seem to be moving forward in accordance with each other. </p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because of my constant worrying, that I&#8217;m feeling terrified as well. I&#8217;m terrified about the future, and the decisions I have to make today, in the vain illusion that I am securing my future. A stable job and a healthy career, how I conduct myself and how vulnerable I should be, so that I may find a partner, which creative endeavours I still have feelings for to grow as a human being, and perhaps the crux of it all, to find my spiritual centre again. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m terrified, because the stablising aspect of having a job that is bound by a timetable and strict bureaucracy, while  it helps me organise my life and perhaps be a higher functioning member of society, seems to take away some of my more creative functions. I&#8217;m terrified that I&#8217;m losing a piece of my identity toward the giant machinations of modern man. I&#8217;m terrified that I&#8217;ll never be able to express myself, or that I&#8217;ll become the machine I so intensely fought when I was a youth. I&#8217;m terrified that the youth of my existence is redundant and no longer necessary in the age of adulthood. Perhaps I&#8217;m terrified that none of that mattered.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m terrified that these fears do not make me the best adult I can be, and for what reason do I want to be this great adult? Mayhaps it has something to do with finally achieving something worthwhile after having all the opportunities and potential to do something, be somewhere or be someone, and you don&#8217;t want it all to come down to squandered chances. Perhaps I&#8217;m terrified of adulthood and the future, because I haven&#8217;t quite gotten all figured out, or that I haven&#8217;t quite gotten it under control. It&#8217;s a terrifying thing when you feel as if you&#8217;re holding on by a thread, that the rest of your life could all hang in the balance because of a single decision, or an attitude, or knowledge, or faith that what you are doing could be the right or wrong thing.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of playing RPGs where you could reload a save point and relive a character&#8217;s life and undo past errors. Gone are the days when life could be escaped into music, television and video games. Gone are the days where life could be escaped by being cryptic on a blog or venting your frustrations in writing and loud music, strange spirits or menthol cigarettes.</p>
<p>For all the times I&#8217;ve tried to resist the pressures of life by simply rolling with the punches, it seems like its time to start to fight back, gain some ground, defend your weak spots and go for the liver shot, crumpling every adversary standing in your way. </p>
<p>But allow me to speak plainly here. I&#8217;m still tired and terrified, and I have no idea how many rounds I can last before the bell rings, when I either win or lose on points, or I win or lose due to a technical knockout, or I win or lose through the sheer brilliance of the knockout of my life. </p>
