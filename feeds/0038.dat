			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oobject is serving up this great collection of <a href="http://www.oobject.com/category/12-soviet-block-computers/">12 Soviet computers</a> from the 1950s through the early 1990s:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Soviet computer manufacture had a promising beginning with devices such as the MESM, which when it was produced in 1950 was the first universally programmable computer in continental Europe. By today’s standards, you’d have to fill the Empire State Building full of MESMs to have the same processing power as an iPhone. Later Soviet block computers were invariably based on Western counterparts with a myriad of Sinclair Spectrum clones, an Apple II based machine, PC compatibles and later on, Vax based systems from Robotron in East Germany.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My favorite is the <a href="http://www.oobject.com/12-soviet-block-computers/1983-agat-apple-ii-clone/8381/">AGAT</a> from 1983, a machine commissioned by the USSR Ministry of Radio that was &#8220;only partially compatible with Apple.&#8221; That monitor is something else! (And so is that color choice.)</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://laze.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/agat.png"><img src="http://laze.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/agat.png" alt="" title="agat" width="300" height="352" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33474" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agat_computer">Apparently</a>, because of the lack of a source for a 6502 processor, they initially used a &#8220;partitioned 588 series&#8221; CPU that simulated 6502 instructions. <a href="http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=509&#038;st=1">Additionally</a>, the ROM (presumably when they shifted to an actual 6502) still had Steve Wozniak&#8217;s name in memory. The unit was primarily used in school settings and had an available &#8220;Schkol&#8217;nitza&#8221; (&#8220;schoolgirl&#8221;) package to help teachers make use of it.</p>
<p>Curious about the AGAT computing experience? Of course there&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.applearchives.com/apple-ii-emulation/agat-soviet-apple-ii-emulat.html">emulator available</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a mid-sized city being built in New Mexico with a population of zero. Yet, there will be traffic lights, energy, and other things you might expect in a town with inhabitants. Except there won&#8217;t be any. Sounds like a <em>Twilight Zone</em> episode, but <a href="http://www.pegasusglobalholdings.com/press-releases/center-for-innovation-testing-and-evaluation-010911.html">it&#8217;s not</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Center will resemble a mid-sized American city, including urban canyons, suburban neighborhoods, rural communities and distant localities. It will offer the only of its kind opportunity to replicate the real-world challenges of upgrading existing city infrastructure to that of a 21st Century smart city, operating within a green economy.</p>
<p>“The idea for The Center was born out of our own company’s challenges in trying to test new and emerging technologies beyond the confines of a sterile lab environment,” Robert H. Brumley, Pegasus Global’s CEO said. “As entrepreneurs, we saw a global need and stepped up to address it. The Center will allow private companies, not for profits, educational institutions and government agencies to test in a unique facility with real world infrastructure, allowing them to better understand the cost and potential limitations of new technologies prior to introduction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Construction of The Center’s test facilities and supporting infrastructure may require as much as 20 square miles of open, unimproved land. It will be designed to represent the current mix of old and new infrastructure found in most modern U.S. cities.</p>
<p>The Center will provide the opportunity for “end-to-end” testing, evaluation and demonstration of new intelligent and green technologies and innovations emerging from the world’s public laboratories, universities, and the private sector with the goal of determining  the direct and indirect benefits and costs the innovations tested would have on our existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>For example, this controlled environment would permit evaluation of the positive and negative impacts of smart grid applications and integration of renewable energies for residential, commercial and industrial sectors of the economy. Additional testing opportunities would include technologies emerging in intelligent traffic systems, next-generation wireless networks, smart grid cyber security and terrorism vulnerability.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Is it weird that I&#8217;d like to take a vacation there?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1975, Elton John released &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Someone_Saved_My_Life_Tonight">Someone Saved My Life Tonight</a>,&#8221; a single off of that year&#8217;s <em>Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy</em>, his most personal and, arguably, his best record. &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR7a0Gm379E">Someone Saved&#8230;</a>&#8221; was one of those songs that, even if you didn&#8217;t know specifically what he was referring to, you could tell that it was about <a href="http://www.eltonography.com/songs/someone_saved_my_life_tonight.html">a turning point</a> in his life:</p>
<p align="center"><iframe width="425" height="25" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kR7a0Gm379E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>
When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights,<br />
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs.<br />
Prima Donna, lord, you really should have been there,<br />
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair.<br />
And it&#8217;s one more beer and I don&#8217;t hear you anymore.<br />
We&#8217;ve all gone crazy lately,<br />
My friends out there rolling round the basement floor.</p>
<p>And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear.<br />
You almost had your hooks in me didn&#8217;t you, dear&#8230;<br />
You nearly had me roped and tied,<br />
Altar-bound, hypnotized,<br />
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear.<br />
You&#8217;re a butterfly&#8230;<br />
And butterflies are free to fly,<br />
Fly away, high away, bye bye.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve long been a fan of this song, but never really knew the story behind it. The &#8220;Prima Donna&#8221; referred to is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIv8-uo9nVA">Linda Woodrow</a> (now, Linda Hannon), who John was engaged to in 1969. According to Hannon, in 1970, John came home drunk one night and broke off the marriage, saying he had to put his career first. Though Hannon disputes that she was &#8220;dominating&#8221; or &#8220;had [her] hooks in [him],&#8221; John credits fellow singer <a href="<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_John_Baldry">Long John Baldry</a> with talking him out of the marriage, making Baldry the &#8220;someone&#8221; in the song&#8217;s title.</p>
<p>Baldry and John were in a band together in the mid-60s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluesology">Bluesology</a>, along with future Soft Machine member Elton Dean. John developed his stage name by combining Elton Dean and John Baldry&#8217;s first names. Baldry himself was gay and came out as such in the early 1960s. John didn&#8217;t come out until the late 1980s after a failed marriage.</p>
<p>Whether or not both John and Hannon felt the relationship was as one-sided as John paints it in his lyrics, it&#8217;s clear that he was conflicted at the time not only about how a marriage would affect his burgeoning career, but also his own sexuality, making &#8220;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&#8221; such a deeply personal song that is still extremely evocative, even 36 years later.</p>
<blockquote><p>
I never realised the passing hours of evening showers,<br />
A slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams,<br />
I&#8217;m strangled by your haunted social scene,<br />
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen.<br />
It&#8217;s four o&#8217;clock in the morning,<br />
Damn it, listen to me good,<br />
I&#8217;m sleeping with myself tonight,<br />
Saved in time, thank God my music&#8217;s still alive.</p>
<p>And I would have walked head on into the deep end of the river<br />
Clinging to your stocks and bonds,<br />
Paying your H.P. demands forever.<br />
They&#8217;re coming in the morning with a truck to take me home<br />
Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight.<br />
Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight.<br />
Someone saved my life tonight.<br />
So save your strength and run the field you play alone.
</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things over on <a href="/fait/archive/2002/07/28/maurys-blooper/">the Maury post</a> have quieted down, as tends to happen when you close comments on a post. But, for fun, I recently made a visit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maury_Povich">Maury&#8217;s Wikipedia entry</a>, which has my blog entry linked up. Then I clicked over to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Maury_Povich">Talk</a> page for Maury and found this gem:</p>

<p>I had to laugh.</p>
<p>(Random Maury-blog-post-related story: A few years back at WebVisions in Portland, <a href="http://www.paulmcaleer.com/">Paul</a> and I were standing around with a few people, one of whom was <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt Haughey</a>. Since Matt was the one who <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2004/05/dear-maury.html">helped make the Maury post a sensation</a>, I thought I&#8217;d be funny and introduce myself to him as Maury. He looked at me like I was an idiot and moved on.)</p>

<p align="center"><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,28,0" width="300" height="250"><param name="movie" value="http://8tracks.com/mixes/347468/player_v3"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://8tracks.com/mixes/347468/player_v3" pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="300" height="250" allowscriptaccess="always" ></embed></object></p>
<p>There are a few tracks I wasn&#8217;t able to get on here (stuff by the Beastie Boys and Honey Ear Trio), but otherwise it&#8217;s a nice little mix of hip-hop, reggae, dubstep, and folk. Admittedly, it&#8217;s a bit heavy on the hip-hop and beat side of things, but hey. That&#8217;s what you get.</p>
<p>Comments appreciated.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1964, <em>Downbeat</em> magazine published a <a href="http://www.forghieri.net/jazz/blind/Davis_3.html">blindfold test</a> with jazz legend Miles Davis, testing his ability to pick out fellow musicians based on the way they played. Predictably, Davis did quite well identifying the players, but didn&#8217;t hold back choice words that he had about many of them.</p>
<p>On saxophonist Eric Dolphy:</p>
<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s got to be Eric Dolphy &#8211; nobody else could sound that bad! The next time I see him I&#8217;m going to step on his foot. You print that. I think he&#8217;s ridiculous. He&#8217;s a sad motherfucker.</p></blockquote>
<p>On free jazz stalwart, pianist Cecil Taylor:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Downbeat: L.F.: This man said he was influenced by Duke Ellington.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t give a shit! It must be Cecil Taylor. Right? I don&#8217;t care who he&#8217;s inspired by. That shit ain&#8217;t nothing. In the first place he don&#8217;t have the &#8211; you know, the way you touch a piano. He doesn&#8217;t have the touch that would make the sound of whatever he thinks of come off.</p></blockquote>
<p>On Les McCann and the Jazz Crusaders playing Davis&#8217; own &#8220;All Blues&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s that supposed to be? That ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;. They don&#8217;t know what to do with it &#8211; you either play it bluesy or you play on the scale. You don&#8217;t just play flat notes. I didn&#8217;t write it to play flat notes on &#8211; you know, like minor thirds. Either you play a whole chord against it, or else . . . but don&#8217;t try to play it like you&#8217;d play, ah, Walkin&#8217; the Dog. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>That trombone player &#8211; trombone ain&#8217;t supposed to sound like that. This is 1964, not 1924. Maybe if the piano player had played it by himself, something would have happened.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Davis got into some left-field style jazz in the 70s with <em>Bitches Brew</em> and the electric fusion that immediately followed, he never did venture into free jazz territory. In 1964, Ornette Coleman, Cecil Taylor, Archie Shepp, and others were braving this new sound and bringing their own approaches to the chaos, but apparently Davis just wasn&#8217;t having it.</p>
<p>In his <em>New Yorker</em> blog post &#8220;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2011/06/miles-davis-peeking-through-the-blindfold.html">Miles Davis: Peeking Through the Blindfold</a>,&#8221; Richard Brody shares an interesting bit I didn&#8217;t realize about Davis&#8217; search for a new saxophonist in the mid-60s:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Davis was looking for a new saxophonist, [drummer Tony] Williams suggested Dolphy; Davis said no. He recommended Archie Shepp; Davis listened and rejected the notion. When Williams proposed [Sam] Rivers, Davis took him on briefly (and recorded with him in Tokyo).</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, given the free and fiery nature of Rivers&#8217; playing at the time, I&#8217;m surprised that Davis didn&#8217;t lump him in with the other free jazz reedmen of the time.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other blindfold tests from <em>Downbeat</em> worth reading with <a href="http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&#038;subsect=story_detail&#038;sid=814">John Coltrane</a> and <a href="http://mingusmingusmingus.com/Mingus/blindfold.html">Charles Mingus</a>.</p>
<p>(<strong>ETA:</strong> There are <a href="http://www.forghieri.net/jazz/blind/">three other Davis blindfold tests</a> as well one with Thelonious Monk worth checking out.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other night, after a fine dinner at Quintessence in the East Village, Huyen and I walked around looking for some art galleries. Unfortunately, we had a heck of a time finding any that a.) still existed and b.) were still open at that time of night. However, we did stumble across three very distinct record shops, none of which I&#8217;d ever been to before.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/rainbow-music-2002-ltd-new-york">Rainbow Records</a></strong></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laze/5827589258/" title="Rainbow by laze, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2504/5827589258_88010059e1.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Rainbow"></a></p>
<p>With records, CDs, and tapes stacked from ceiling to roof making 95% of them inaccessible, this store is &#8220;organized&#8221; in a hoarder-esque fashion. There&#8217;s only a small pathway and in the few minutes I was there, the owner of the store knocked stacks of CDs over three times and had a heck of a time getting a stool back in its place. As messy and crazy as it is, though, you can tell there&#8217;s a lot of love there. I felt bad for not buying anything here because stores with such eccentricities are worth supporting, but I couldn&#8217;t find anything of interest and what I did see was pretty overpriced (99-cent bin-worthy albums selling for $9). I suspect that among the stacks, there are some gems hiding.</p>
<p>To quote <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/rainbow-music-2002-ltd-new-york#hrid:1ZpnILKgnDbDdv67IK00eg">one Yelp reviewer</a>: &#8220;One day, someone will read an obituary in the New York Times about finding the owner of this shop buried alive and rotting under a mammoth stack of used CDs.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mondokims.com/">Kim&#8217;s Video and Music</a></strong></p>
<p>As we walked by this storefront, Huyen pointed out that the TV out front was showing one of the best movies I&#8217;ve seen in recent years, Czech director Jan Švankmajer&#8217;s 1988 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_(1988_film)"><em>Alice</em></a>, a mindbending live action/stop-motion version of Alice in Wonderland. When I inquired about it inside, I found out that it&#8217;s now available as an import Blu-Ray. Consider my mind blown. Sadly, they were out of stock, but I did get a chance to browse their amazing collection of import movies and indie music. I walked out with only a $3 bargain DVD (the documentary <a href="http://stopfollowingme.com/friendsforever/"><em>Friends Forever</em></a>), showing a lot of restraint.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.tropicaliainfurs.com/">Tropicalia Infurs</a></strong></p>
<p>My favorite of the three shops, we stumbled on this one by accident, drawn in by a store window that made it look like a vintage electronics shop. The selection here is very carefully curated, with a super high quality selection of original pressing jazz and funk records (if only they were alphabetized!) and a breathtaking selection of 1960s and 70s 7&#8243;s from France, Africa, and India. They didn&#8217;t have any Chantal Goya, but I did pick up one ye-ye record, one calypso record, and an hip-hop EP from &#8217;98. Neat, neat shop.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not my first print publication, but it&#8217;s mighty close: the February 1988 edition of the <em>Super Saturday Xpress</em>, a photocopied newspaper created for a Saturday morning enrichment class about newspaper production. I was 12, in 7th grade, and my passion for writing about my obsessions was starting to form.</p>
<p>On the front page is my timely take on the Super Bowl that year. In the piece titled, &#8220;Super Bowl Disgrace,&#8221; I eloquently and impartially declare &#8220;This game was the WORST Super Bowl disgrace, except for the 1979 Super Bowl XIII when Pittsburgh beat Dallas.&#8221; Also provided is a handy sidebar of the most significant Super Bowl blowouts (nice touch, 12-year-old me!).</p>
<p>In &#8220;Scoops About Our Staff,&#8221; the paragraph about me helpfully shares, &#8220;He likes hoagies.&#8221; Indeed!</p>
<p>On the same page is an uncredited contribution that&#8217;s clearly mine: a capsule review of L.L. Cool J&#8217;s <em>Bigger and Deffer</em>. What exactly the difference was between a check plus and five checks, I&#8217;m not sure. And I clearly understood that James Todd Smith was trying to target the lucrative &#8220;12-23&#8243; age bracket with his release. This may have been my first published music review.</p>
<p>On the last page, I took out an ad (is that ethical?) to sell my homebrew software for the Apple II. Football (surely <a href="http://www.dailyping.com/archive/2007/06/15/programs-i-wrote-as-a-kid/">Tackle Smash Kill!!</a>) is mentioned, as is wrestling, which I&#8217;d completely forgotten about. (Note to self: create a Youtube series of run-throughs for games I wrote as a kid.) I even offered readers quite the deal: &#8220;A free random number generator to give variety to your programs.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I bought this shirt, I wondered how long it would take wearing it before someone would &#8220;get&#8221; it. I&#8217;m happy to report that only four hours into day one, I got my first response to it.</p>
<p>I was sitting out by the lake reading at lunchtime when a guy walked by and says, &#8220;Awesome shirt! I love it!&#8221; I reacted with surprise that he actually understood it and he explained that he&#8217;s the VP of Marketing for a well-known tech firm located in the next building over.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m helping put together a big 6,000 square foot <a href="http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/">Art of Video Games exhibit</a> at the Smithsonian,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s amazing,&#8221; I replied and then we went back and forth in a game of Odyssey^2 game tennis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember the Lord of the Rings knock-off? And Wall Street?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFy876HAV4Q">Pick Axe Pete</a>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell yeah! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07JtE4pIq8U">KC Munchkin</a>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Which reminds me. I totally need to create a <a href="http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&#038;id=109">Pick Axe Pete</a> t-shirt.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jay Smooth recently linked up <a href="http://jsmooth995.tumblr.com/post/5851256368/the-thing-with-the-n-word-its-very-very">an interview he did with Brother Ali</a> a little while back:</p>
<p align="center"><iframe width="499" height="284" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CCsCix12-J0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Ali notes that when he was nine years old and had mostly black friends, he was fully accepted by them and felt that he was one of them. By this, I presume he means he felt entitled to use the n-word amongst them. But as he grew older, he realized why being down didn&#8217;t give him the right, as a white person, to use that word.</p>
<p>I remember struggling with this a bit growing up, too. While I wasn&#8217;t in a situation where my friends were mostly black (c&#8217;mon &#8211; my high school of 2000 people had 10 black students), I do remember feeling that because I was so deeply into hip-hop that I somehow had a pass to use that word in my lyrics. You know, artistically. I only used it once or twice, but looking back, I still feel guilt for ever even letting such a loaded word escape my lips.</p>
<p>A key point in this interview comes where Ali says, &#8220;We have to own our relationship to our injustice in the world.&#8221; We all are the culmination of the history that proceeded us and as a white person, it&#8217;s undeniable that I&#8217;m still reaping the benefits of the systemic discrimination of minorities in the years before I was born (and, indeed, in the years since). I can&#8217;t help what happened, but accepting it, realizing it, and &#8220;own[ing] our relationship&#8221; to it is an important step in addressing race honestly.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was in college in the mid-1990s, I was a pretty heavy hip-hop fan and had been for a while, but I had only started listening to reggae a few years before. Shabba Ranks&#8217; &#8220;<a href="http://www.pp2g.tv/vYXx6ZHA_.aspx">Trailor Load of Girls</a>&#8221; was the first reggae song I distinctly remembered liking. It took some time, but eventually I was listening to Half Pint and starting to dive deeper into roots reggae.</p>
<p>Somehow&#8211;and honestly, I don&#8217;t remember how&#8211;I was given the opportunity to write for <a href="http://www.reggaereport.com/"><em>Reggae Report</em></a> magazine, one of the most widely (if not <em>the</em> most widely) circulated print reggae magazine. It was quite a privilege to write for them and I was in some truly good company, especially considering how green I was. I can remember editor Sara Gurgen&#8217;s surprise when she had to explain to me what &#8220;<a href="http://www.vegblog.org/archive/2001/08/22/ital-is-vital/">ital</a>&#8221; food was (and look at me now, one of the top five Google search results for the phrase!).</p>
<p>During my college stint, I wrote lots of reviews and the occasional feature article, including interviews with Mad Professor and Half Pint. I&#8217;ve always been thankful to the magazine&#8217;s founder M. Peggy Quattro and editor Sara Gurgen for giving me that shot. Because of that gig, I was introduced to amazing music and amazing people.</p>
<p>Today, Peggy celebrates her 30th year in the reggae business. If you know your music history, you may also know that today marks <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/blog/2011/05/30-years-after-bob-marleys-death.html">30 years since Bob Marley died</a>. It was quite a first day on the job for Peggy, who <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150180096498462">describes the day</a> on <em>Reggae Report</em>&#8216;s Facebook page:</p>
<blockquote><p>
10 a.m., May 11, 1981, I walk into DTAM with a heightened sense that something big was about to happen.  I was imagining getting to meet Bob Marley, although I knew he was very ill and passing through Miami on his journey back home to Jamaica.  I was nervous and excited at the same time.  Don wasn’t there yet so I took it upon myself to organize my new office.  There were pictures of Bob and Jimmy, posters, gold records, and boxes of papers and receipts everywhere.  Herman, Don’s go-to guy/driver had reported in to help.  By 11 a.m. I had my space semi-worked out and Herman and I chatted about Bob and he let me know just how serious Bob’s illness was.  I was devastated.  No, not Bob, not now.  There was so much more for him to do, concerts to give, songs to record, lives to touch. </p>
<p>Don came bursting in looking very grave and serious.  He barked a few instructions to get ready for Jimmy Cliff coming into town in a couple days.  Oh my, I thought, Jimmy Cliff!  You can get it if you really want it, harder they come…I was going to meet my idol, the man drawing 80,000-100,000 fans in Europe and Brazil.  This was great!</p>
<p>At 11:45 a.m. the phone rang.  Rita Marley asking for Don.  My stomach sank.  Don grabbed the call and raced out the door.  Not before stopping to look me in the eye and say, “If anyone calls, you know nothing.”  In fact, I knew nothing, but the sinking feeling grew and Herman and I looked at each other with a knowing glance that this was possibly it.  The moment everyone dreaded, the moment we prayed not to happen, we knew.  Bob was gone.
</p></blockquote>
<p>30 years later, she&#8217;s launching a new project, raising funds <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reggaereport/reggae-report-archive-30-year-collection-know-your-0">through Kickstarter</a> for the Reggae Report Archive. She&#8217;s making available the entire magazine archive as well as exclusive audio interviews (I&#8217;ll have to dig up some of my old tapes!) and video. It&#8217;s a great project and if reggae music has made a mark on your life, I encourage you to drop a few coins in the bucket:</p>

<p>Congrats to MPQ and best of luck with this great endeavor.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://soulliberty.com/">Soul Liberty</a> isn&#8217;t a site I exactly frequent (that is to say, today was my first visit) and I&#8217;m surely not the target audience, but you&#8217;ve gotta be impressed at the time and thought that went into putting together <a href="http://soulliberty.com/View.php?ID=5052">God&#8217;s Family Tree</a>:</p>
<p align="center"><script src="http://zoom.it/jOiY.js?width=auto&#038;height=400px"></script></p>
<p><a href="http://soulliberty.com/blog/?p=241">This post</a> details how the graph was created: the sources, the decision to show only male parentage, and the applications used to delve into the complex data set. Creator Robert Rouse describes his filtering decisions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I made this using a tool called Gephi which is great for deep analysis of complex networks, especially social connections.  Instead of a social network, I mapped blood relationships.  But, not all of them ended up in the final view.  The first filter I applied was to show only the male parentage, for two reasons: 1) the Bible generally lists longer genealogies by fathers only, and 2) interconnections with spouses and mothers create an intricate web which makes it far too difficult to follow on a large scale (as shown above).  The second filter I applied was to remove any person whose ancestry could not be traced all the way back to Adam and Eve.  These people and connections appear as distracting “floaters”&#8230;</p>
<p>None of this is to say that spouses, mothers, and “floater” families are unimportant.  If they were, I doubt they’d be listed in the Bible at all.  Rather, the intent here is to make long, complex chains that link from God the Father to God the Son easier to follow and understand.  For many people, visual displays are easier to comprehend than a list of names spread across multiple books of the Bible.  But, not every kind of visual display does the job.  Besides the filters I’ve mentioned above, I experimented with different layouts.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascinating stuff from a data visualization perspective alone.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While working on the relaunch of this site, I was thinking in the back of my head that it had been maybe five-ish years since I last redesigned the site. Turns out it&#8217;s been <a href="/fait/archive/2003/07/27/first-post-redesign-post-post/">nearly eight years</a>. That&#8217;s, um, a long time.</p>
<p>And a lot has happened in those eight years. When I launched that redesign, I was in the middle of my third Blogathon (the first two I participated in; the third I helped monitor). I was in my just-barely-late-20s. I was blogging something almost every day. I was running a myriad sites.</p>
<p>What happened since then? Facebook. Twitter. Fatherhood.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, my blog disintegrated into a dusty pile of auto-posted delicious links. I wrote one or two posts of substance per year. I moved the mundane thoughts to Twitter. I made a conscious decision to move more personal postings to Facebook. But I never quite figured out what to do with laze.net.</p>
<p>So, here I am, in 2011. Mid-30s. Dad. Several sites lighter. And feeling ready to revive this thing and give it another go.</p>
<p>From a design standpoint, even though I&#8217;m calling this a redesign, it&#8217;s not really. I&#8217;m just tweaking an existing template a little bit. I decided it was time to move to a simpler layout and clear out some cruft on the site (yeah, I know URLs should never die, but some of this content is begging to be killed). I like the one-column look this theme has and am perfectly happy not trying to cram every bit of content I&#8217;m producing into a sidebar.</p>
<p>From a content perspective, I&#8217;ve killed the auto-posted delicious links and while I&#8217;ve kept all the old blog content (I couldn&#8217;t let <a href="/fait/archive/2002/07/28/maurys-blooper/">Maury</a> go away, could I?), I&#8217;ve moved it all under a category called &#8220;Zee Classic Collection<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.&#8221; While I&#8217;m not going to be posting anywhere near everyday, I&#8217;m shooting for a few moderate-length posts per month. Think Kottke minus the posts about David Foster Wallace, Errol Morris, and foodie topics. I&#8217;ll write about the stuff that interests me at the moment: tea, movies, music, retrofuturism, and Japanese fiction with the occasional bits of parenting, politics, and technology. I&#8217;m going to do my best to not jump on a topic just because everyone else is. I&#8217;m done with that game. I just want to write some good stuff about things I care about.</p>
<p>This is definitely a work in progress. Stuff&#8217;s going to break. I may bring some old content back. I&#8217;m experimenting with different content aggregation methods.</p>
<p>Dig in, enjoy, and pass along any feedback. Not sure how many of my old visitors are checking in, but if you are, say hi!</p>
<p><a name="1"></a><br />
<sup>1</sup> <small>Why &#8220;Zee&#8221;? Because &#8220;Zee&#8221; sounds like &#8220;the&#8221; when said by a stereotypical movie Frenchman. Oh yeah, and because it&#8217;ll cause it to sort last on my <a href="/archive/">archive page</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few things I&#8217;ve read recently worth sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://simonchamberlain.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/harper-collins-and-ebooks/"><strong>Harper Collins and ebooks</strong></a> &#8211; Publisher Harper Collins is changing the terms of their sales of ebooks to libraries. Now, a license for an ebook will expire after 26 loans. WTF? Are they going to come and burn all the paper copies after a couple of dozen loans, too? This blog has a good summary of what&#8217;s going on.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201101/bunny-wailer-john-jeremiah-sullivan?printable=true"><strong>The Last Wailer</strong></a> &#8211; Great GQ piece on the reclusive Bunny Wailer. (via <a href="http://www.longform.org">longform</a>, which you should follow, if you already don&#8217;t)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/magazine/06FOB-onlanguage-t.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss"><strong>On Worst Comes to Worst</strong></a> &#8211; I always thought that &#8220;if worse comes to worst&#8221; was preferable to &#8220;if worst comes to worst,&#8221; but apparently the latter is the original (though both terms are generally considered to be OK).</li>
<li><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=12864672"><strong><br />
Publisher defends book on Polish plunder of Jews</strong></a> &#8211; <em>Golden Harvest</em> is due out later this year and details how some Poles plundered graves and sold out Jews&#8217; hiding spots for financial gain. There should be no shame in visiting this part of Poland&#8217;s history: acknowledge it, learn from it, and use it to move forward.</li>
<li><a href="http://vice.typepad.com/vice_magazine/2007/01/qa_lee_perry.html"><strong>Interview &#8211; Lee &#8220;Scratch&#8221; Perry (2007)</strong></a> &#8211; Perry has a surprisingly progressive view on homosexuality (especially given reggae&#8217;s historical condemnation of LGBT folk), but it&#8217;s also very much &#8220;Scratch&#8221;: &#8220;Gay people have the right to live their life, and I wouldn’t say that they shouldn’t live the life they should live because they were once woman. After they reincarnate they come back as man. They achieve two different power – they achieve the power of man and the woman. We all are male and female but some of us don’t know how to handle it. We are all male and we are all female in one body; two power in one body. But if the woman in the gay want to live a woman life, let the woman in the gay live a woman life. And if the man in the gay wish to life a man life, let the man in the gay live a man life. I have nothing to say against them.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://emilyannereed.com/"><strong>Emily Anne Reed</strong></a> &#8211; Shame she didn&#8217;t make it through on <em>American Idol</em>. Really liked her.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fieldhymns.com/blog/2011/02/worlds-collide/"><strong>Kenny G and Miles Davis (photo)</strong></a> &#8211; Best thing I&#8217;ve seen this week. Miles is looking at Kenny G the way we all hope he would.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.legacy.com/guestbook/courierpostonline/guestbook.aspx?n=lana-cokos&#038;pid=148892089&#038;cid=full"><strong>RIP, Lana Cokos</strong></a> &#8211; My fifth grade math teacher. She was great.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.paleofuture.com/blog/2011/1/18/edisons-predictions-for-the-year-2011-1911.html">Paleo-future</a> shares an article from 1911 where Thomas Edison laid down some predictions a hundred years later.  Guess what?  It&#8217;s a hundred years later.</p>
<p>There are some intriguing predictions (&#8220;The baby of the twenty-first century will be rocked in a steel cradle&#8221;), but the most interesting is his take on 21st century books:</p>
<blockquote><p>Books of the coming century will all be printed leaves of nickel, so light to hold that the reader can enjoy a small library in a single volume. A book two inches thick will contain forty thousand pages, the equivalent of a hundred volumes; six inches in aggregate thickness, it would suffice for all the contents of the Encyclopedia Britannica. And each volume would weigh less than a pound.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then a paragraph later he makes reference to &#8220;Wood <strong>kindle</strong>-ing from the deep forests of the <strong>Amazon</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, he doesn&#8217;t, but it would have been kind of cool if he did.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Belleruche: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VW8C1I/?tag=vegblog-20"><em>270 Stories</em></a></strong><br />
Belleruche&#8217;s approach of combining turntables and soulful vocals (&#8220;Influenced by vintage blues records, punk girl drummers, obscure 60&#8242;s cover bands and experimental west coast turntablists&#8221;) reminds me a lot of what we heard from Kristin Mainhart and the Khromozomes crew in the earlier part of the decade.  Great, danceable, funky tunes very much in line with their excellent &#8220;Turntable Soul Music&#8221; from 2008.  The video for &#8220;Fuzz Face&#8221; is also well worth checking (every frame was photocopied to hell to create a really ill visual distortion).  Favorite cuts: &#8220;Fuzz Face,&#8221; &#8220;3 Amp Fuse,&#8221; and &#8220;Gold Rush.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Black Sheep: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UNKFPO/?tag=vegblog-20"><em>From The Black Pool Of Genius</em></a></strong><br />
For some reason, this album completely flew under the radar.  From my recollection, almost no one talked about it after the first week it was out.  But, honestly, it&#8217;s pretty darn good.  Production&#8217;s dope and no fan of early-90s hip-hop can tell me that they didn&#8217;t get geeked from &#8220;Elevation&#8221; or the Native Tongues&#8217; reunion track &#8220;Birds of a Feather&#8221; (even with the awkward levels on the mix).</li>
<li><strong>Boog Brown: <a href="http://mellomusicgroup.bandcamp.com/album/brown-study"><em>Brown Study</em></a></strong><br />
Voiced by Detroit native Boog Brown and produced by the (I-finally-realize-he&#8217;s) super dope Apollo Brown, <em>Brown Study</em> is packed with some genuinely awesome tracks, including the amazing &#8220;Friction&#8221; featuring Miz Korona and perennial laze.net favorite Invincible (if she&#8217;s not making an album of the year, she&#8217;s appearing on them), &#8220;Friends Like These&#8221; featuring Kam Moye/Supastition, &#8220;Play the Game&#8221; featuring Ken Starr, and &#8220;Marinate.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>CeHa: <em>Bilet</em></strong><br />
Driving Polish hip-hop with some excellent production.  Favorite track: the reggae-inspired &#8220;R&oacute;b, Co Chcesz.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Celph Titled &#038; Buckwild: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004562NMI/?tag=vegblog-20"><em>Ninteen-Ninety-Now</em></a></strong><br />
Original, unused mid-90s Buckwild beats lacing Celph Titled verses?  Um, yes please.  Great stuff, including guest spots from Treach, Demigodz, Celph Titled, and a massive posse cut with Sadat X, Grand Puba, A.G., O.C., and Diamond D.  Favorite cuts: &#8220;Swashbuckling,&#8221; &#8220;There Will Be Blood,&#8221; and &#8220;Styles Ain&#8217;t Raw.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Clutchy Hopkins: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003A0619Q/?tag=vegblog-20"><em>The Story Teller</em></a></strong><br />
In a world where everyone knows everything, it&#8217;s kinda cool that the mystery behind Clutchy Hopkins has remained a mystery.  Is he really DJ Shadow?  Cut Chemist?  Madlib?  Whatever the case, the music sounds is like a folky funk live-instrument amalgam of all of them.</li>
<li><strong>El Da Sensei &#038; The Returners: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043WGS1G/?tag=vegblog-20"><em>Nu World</em></a></strong><br />
El and Tame are working on an Artifacts album, but until then, we have their excellent solo work to enjoy.  Tame had two killer albums last year (one solo and one with Del) and El&#8217;s work with Polish production duo The Returners this year was every bit as good as his first outing with them a few years back.  A great, great release.  Best cuts: &#8220;Knowledge Be the Key&#8221; featuring Raaka, &#8220;2 the Death,&#8221; and &#8220;Live Noize&#8221; featuring Akrobatik.</li>
<li><strong>Igor Boxx: <a href="http://ninjatune.net/release/igor-boxx/breslau-and-1945-ep"><em>Breslau</em></a></strong><br />
From the Skalpel crew, Igor Boxx&#8217;s solo venture at first may not seem quite as interesting as the group&#8217;s work, but with repeated listenings, it really opens up.  Great, deeply personal music.</li>
<li><strong>Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00377E4SC/?tag=vegblog-20"><em>I Learned the Hard Way</em></a></strong><br />
Do all the analysis you want about white kids and the popularity of retro-soul of the last decade thanks to labels like Daptone, Soul Fire, and One Note, there&#8217;s no denying that Sharon Jones <em>tears shit up</em>.  <em>I Learned the Hard Way</em> is a phenomenal release, full of the fire and soul that R&#038;B hasn&#8217;t had in decades.  Classic recording equipment and techniques are an important part of the equation, but if Jones&#8217; presence and voice weren&#8217;t there, all the recording gimmicks in the world wouldn&#8217;t matter.  Top-to-bottom, this one&#8217;s a classic will be in rotation for many years to come.  Favorite cut: &#8220;Money.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Flying Lotus: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ATUFSK/?tag=vegblog-20"><em>Cosmogramma</em></a></strong><br />
Too busy?  Phooey.  Too blippy?  Nah.  All I know is that I&#8217;m continuing to dig the insanity and complexity.</li>
<li><strong>The Left: <a href="http://mellomusicgroup.bandcamp.com/album/gas-mask"><em>Gas Mask</em></a></strong> (<a href="http://mellomusicgroup.bandcamp.com/album/gas-leaks-ep">also</a>)<br />
Producer Apollo Brown is another guy behind the sampler that had a great year, laying down the foundation for two of my favorite albums of the year, Boog Brown&#8217;s aforementioned <em>Brown Study</em> and this collaboration with MC Journalist 103 and DJ Soko.  The classic formula: dope MC, soulful beats, and cuts (though I could have used some more of the latter).  Favorite cuts: &#8220;Statistics (feat. Invincible),&#8221; &#8220;Gas Mask,&#8221; and &#8220;The Melody&#8221; (where Journalist 103 is on a Supastition steez).  A month after the album hit, a 3-track EP of leftover cuts was released as <em>Gas Leaks</em>.  It&#8217;s also worth snagging.</li>
<li><strong>Little Miss Higgins: <a href="http://www.outside-music.com/store/product.php?productid=16511&#038;cat=0&#038;page=1"><em>Across the Plains</em></a></strong><br />
The album has firmly planted Little Miss Higgins amongst my favorite modern blues singers alongside Brownbird Rudy Relic, CW Stoneking, and Mamie Minch.  Just, wow.  There&#8217;s some serious power behind this creativity, as seen on &#8220;Bargain! Shop Panties,&#8221; </li>
<li><strong>oddisee: <a href="http://oddisee.bandcamp.com/album/odd-winter"><em>Odd Winter</em></a></strong><br />
Released in January, this one started the year off wonderfully.  Oddisee is one of the most inventive and talented producers in hip-hop right now, able to tackle pretty much any style with ease and expertise, and this collection is a good example of his versatility.  From the outstanding hands-on-the-lunchtable battle track &#8220;Riiight (feat. Stik Figa)&#8221; to the choppy &#8220;Carry On&#8221; to the mellowy-soulful &#8220;All Because She&#8217;s Gone.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>PackFM: <a href="http://ifuckinghaterappers.com/"><em>I F*cking Hate Rappers</em></a></strong><br />
&#8220;Too many MC&#8217;s, not enough fans.&#8221;  The title track is the anthem for anyone who&#8217;s overwhelmed with the barrage of hip-hop by barely talented bedroom rappers and for the true MC&#8217;s and producers tired of nobodies talking shit with authority just because they were on a mixtape.  But this 15-track (5 are skits) release isn&#8217;t a one-note pony.  Pack brings heat on &#8220;Wanna Know&#8221; with labelmate Deacon the Villain, &#8220;Here We Go (Come On),&#8221; &#8220;Absolutely Positive,&#8221; &#8220;Sire&#8221; (Pack&#8217;s take on &#8220;King of Rock&#8221;), and the 180 degree turn from the title track titled &#8220;I F*cking Like Everything.&#8221;  The skits are well done, but of course, get a little tired on repeated listening (though I&#8217;ll never tire of the &#8220;I think my Aunt got signed to Koch last week&#8221; line on the intro).  The production by Kno, Tonedeff, Domingo, J-Zone, and others is great.</li>
<li><strong>Pink Freud: <a href="http://www.pinkfreud.art.pl/"><em>Monster of Jazz</em></a></strong><br />
Since one of my favorites bands of all-time, the brillant Polish post-contemporary jazz group Robotobibok, broke up a few years ago, I&#8217;ve been leaning on groups like Pink Freud to keep me happy.  Like their previous output, Pink Freud&#8217;s &#8220;Monster of Jazz&#8221; is a wonderfully eclectic selection of modern jazz with splashes of electronica.</li>
<li><strong>POE (Projekt Ostry Emade): <a href="http://asfaltshop.pl/projekt-ostry-emade-zlodzieje-zapalniczek-p-319.html"><em>Złodzieje zapalniczek</em></a></strong><br />
I anxiously awaited this late-year release from the moment I heard about it.  Emade&#8217;s a dope producer and OSTR is a great MC (ahd producer, but I don&#8217;t think he got behind the boards at all on this one) and the album didn&#8217;t disappoint.  I only got to listen to it a couple of times since it took me until mid-December to get a copy, but it&#8217;s a great Polish hip-hop release with a classic style.  Combine it with the full set of accompanying instrumentals, and I&#8217;m happy.  Favorites: &#8220;Nie odejdę stąd,&#8221; &#8220;Nadzieja,&#8221; and &#8220;Ty Znasz Ten Stan.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Rakaa: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003KNVDNM/?tag=vegblog-20"><em>Crown of Thorns</em></a></strong><br />
Of course Rakaa&#8217;s a dope MC, but when you give him some amazing production on every single track, you&#8217;re going to end up with an album of the year.  There&#8217;s certainly no album that got more rotation for me than this one, due in part to the amazing &#8220;Delilah&#8221; and one of the sharpest political songs I&#8217;ve heard in a long time, &#8220;The Observatory&#8221; (featuring Mad Lion).</li>
<li><strong>Reason: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003FF87RK/?tag=vegblog-20"><em>Landlords &#038; Lullabies</em></a></strong><br />
I wasn&#8217;t really too familiar with Rhode Island MC Reason, but I checked out some recent mixtapes and eventually bought the CD of his 2010 LP <em>Landlords &#038; Lullabies</em>.  His style may not be for everyone, but I really dug this release from the top down.  Favorite tracks: &#8220;Paid Bills,&#8221; &#8220;Girls with Cameras,&#8221; and &#8220;Clingers&#8221; (featuring Dirty Hank).</li>
<li><strong>Sade: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YIHO7I/?tag=vegblog-20"><em>Soldier of Love</em></a></strong><br />
Receiving a massive PR push when it was released in January, Sade&#8217;s first album in a decade surprised the hell out of me.  The title track/lead single was straight fire and the rest of the album was almost as good (other favorites: &#8220;The Moon and the Sky&#8221; and &#8220;Long Hard Raod&#8221;).  This is one of those rare releases that matches voice and music so perfectly.</li>
<li><strong>Scanner with the Post Modern Jazz Quartet: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041NZN2M/?tag=vegblog-20"><em>Blink of an Eye</em></strong></a><br />
The problem with blending jazz with any other genre is that the jazz almost always suffers.  Guru&#8217;s <em>Jazzmatazz</em> series was good, but you weren&#8217;t hearing any hard-bop complexity in the song structure.  It&#8217;s rare that one can do what Scanner and the Post Modern Jazz Quartet have done here: mesh blippy electronica with post-contemporary jazz and make it sound &#8220;right.&#8221;  The key is that this is a jazz album first.  Scanner&#8217;s contributions, while certainly not an afterthought, are understated.  Rather than becoming the focus, they&#8217;re an accent.  Half the time, one doesn&#8217;t even realize Scanner&#8217;s doing anything, until you realize that the swirly effect that swooped in was his doing. On &#8220;Dreaming With You at My Side&#8221; (probably the least &#8220;jazzy&#8221; of the tracks here) the fuzzy bleeps somehow mesh with vibraphones and dub-style reverb on keys doesn&#8217;t sound out of place.</p>
<p>My favorite track on the album is the closer, &#8220;Beyond the Edge of the Frame,&#8221; a frenetic breakbeat with piano and vibes and Scanner&#8217;s occasional interjections.  While structurally it&#8217;s not as complex as the other tracks on the album, it has a drive behind it that&#8217;s hard to resist.</li>
<li><strong>Sxip Shirey: <a href="http://sxip.bandcamp.com/"><em>Sonic New York</em></a></strong><br />
I came across this one late in year, after listening to an <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/2010/oct/08/its-alive/">episode of &#8220;Radiolab&#8221; featuring Shirey</a>.  Really unique instrumentation mixed with ambient sounds of the city.  Sounds like a played out combination, but it works quite well.</li>
<li><strong>Stik Figa &#038; D/WILL: <a href="http://dwill.bandcamp.com/album/alive-well"><em>Alive &#038; Well</em></a></strong><br />
Stik Figa had quite a year with several dope releases hitting the net.  His work with Oddisee on the <em>From the Top</em> was really dope, but I actually preferred <em>Alive &#038; Well</em>, his follow-up with D/WILL to 2009&#8242;s <em>hellogoodbye</em>.  I wasn&#8217;t familiar with D/WILL as a producer before his work with Stik, but I&#8217;m digging his sound.  Stik Figa mayne!  Favorite cuts: &#8220;Be Like That,&#8221; &#8220;The Down,&#8221; and &#8220;Alive.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Cassandra Wilson: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00389JFW4/?tag=vegblog-20"><em>Silver Pony</em></a></strong><br />
Cassandra never fails to impress, but I think <em>Silver Pony</em>, an interesting mix of live and studio recordings, may be my favorite release of hers in the last decade.  Love that voice.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I had to limit myself to one favorite, I&#8217;d pick two.  Sharon Jones and Raaka.  There you go&#8230; enjoy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I were the type to focus on the negative things that happened during the year (which I sometimes am), I&#8217;d note that Amina&#8217;s illness and death were a huge strain on all of us emotionally for the first half of the year.  I&#8217;d also look back to things I wrote late last year and in January of this year about my hopes and plans for the year and how I missed the mark on pretty much every front.  There were a couple of very specific changes I wanted to make this year that I didn&#8217;t.  Again.  And it&#8217;s getting hard to keep failing myself like that.</p>
<p>A few things I worked on this year that I&#8217;m pleased with: I journaled a lot more (using 750words.com and then importing into my desktop journal software), I ran far more than any previous year (231 miles, though I was as inconsistent as ever, aside from October), and we travelled a fair amount.</p>
<p>All-in-all, it was actually a pretty good year.  I didn&#8217;t document as much online this year and find myself generally being slightly less forthcoming than I was in the past, but I decided to write up a rundown of my year, for what&#8217;s it&#8217;s worth.  Last year, I found that I enjoyed the process of putting the list together and I suspect years down the road, I&#8217;ll be glad I did.</p>
<p>2011, bring it on.  I&#8217;m ready for you.  I think.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting on January 1st, I&#8217;m going to disable the automatic posting of delicious links to the blog.  If you want to continue to follow them, you can, over at <a href="http://delicious.com/lazenet">delicious.com/lazenet</a> (for as long as delicious lives, that is).</p>
<p>This is part of a plan to (finally) revamp the entirety of laze.net and move back toward more frequent personal blogging of substance.  Lots of decisions to be made and technical stuff to fret over, but I do plan on getting to it after a couple of years of dust forming on the site.  Achoo.</p>
