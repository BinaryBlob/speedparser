So i was asked to create a site using webjobs ( webScribble &#8211; http//:webjobs.com ). The client already had a site that was built years ago using webJobs v1 and they wanted to upgrade to the latest version 3. 
The software ( latest version ) is a pretty comprehensive version of jobs webboard where you can quickly generate an all singing all dancing website. It offers lots of features &#8211; integration of feeds from other sites, employer and employee login, online sales, backend CMS /  admin system, social site auto login, iPhone site &#8211; the list goes on for a while.
The basic cost of the software is about $400 and the plugins are all extra.
Its basically a step up from a framework &#8211; or a framework thats been developed into a set of top level tools for site building.]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-303" style="vertical-align: top; float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" title="Walking dead" src="http://louiscox.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wd-300x200.jpg" alt="Walking dead" title="wd" width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-705" />
Unbeknown to me the series <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/">Walking Dead</a> is based on a <a href="http://www.hiddenrobot.com/WALKINGDEAD/">comic</a> &#8211; which came as a bit of a shock, and Im not exactly a stranger to comics having been a lifelong reader of <a href="http://www.2000adonline.com/">2000ad</a> since 1977. So great news, a series about zombies in blistering HD quality &#8211; ok audio not that great but still great HD quality. Only six episodes though. What a shame. The series is absolutely fantastic. Its already available in the U.K.via <a href="http://walkingdead.fxuk.com/">U.K.FX.com</a> which is exactly what we were after &#8211; long gone are the days of waiting years for a new series / film in the u.k., now its instant. The main character to boot is &#8220;Egg&#8221; from the old series <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168596/">&#8220;cold feet&#8221;</a>. He has an affected a transatlantic accent but the end result is still good. Obviously Im going to wax lyrical about a zombie series &#8211; its one of a first, but it really is good. If I could level a criticism at it &#8211; the plot wallowed a touch in episodes 3, but other than that it seems to tick along nicely in as you would expect a classic post apocalyptic scenario. On the zombie film scale of things the gore factor is fairly tame but nicely realistic. A good blend. The shooting is really well done with nice touches of atmosphere and realism &#8211; reminiscent although nowhere near as post nuclear as the Road. Im told by an expert that the comics get very dark indeed featuring very controversial plot lines &#8211; so Im presuming the series wont be going there. So Quality &#8211; check, Actors &#8211; check and plot &#8211; check. Its all good. Well worth seeking out if you a confirmed horror freak like myself.

Its my express wish to cover these articles to help out freelancers in similar circumstance and not to attack the reputation of any companies I may have worked with. It has to be said that in my experience as a freelancer all my clients are very good at paying and these cases are very much the exception to the rule. Its not that surprising that these cases have occurred during the height of a financial downturn. This case was a small claims case as opposed to a proper full court claim. Again Im interested in arming the fellow freelancer with the tools and a bit of inspiration to prosecute for non payment. Its not something I want to do as obviously it makes me look like I have been prosecuting lots of cases &#8211; which I haven&#8217;t &#8211; so far only two touch wood &#8211; both agencies. All the information is factually correct as happened to obviously cover myself from any prosecution. There is a lot of information regarding small claims. Its very easy these day and I did mine online, read below for full links.<br/>
<a href="http://www.thewalkeragency.co.uk/">The Walker agency</a>  headed by <a href=http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/martin-walker/15/9a6/537">Martin Walker</a> came to me across Twitter via another employee and asked for a Flash piece based on video. Its all seemed very fair, so I asked for a formal brief. It was critical I did this as later this was brought into question. Always ask for a formal brief. It is the yardstick for what you have produced. The tale of this client non payment is about them asking for alterations and refusing to pay for them. In a way this was a great shame as I quite enjoyed doing the job initially. It was a technical challenge. Essentially they wanted a portfolio that auto loaded separate flash movies and jpegs with various bits of animation and an interactive interface. Fair do&#8217;s. Unfortunately I personally made a mistake when I totally underestimated how much time would be required to technically resolve the problem. That basic problem was the video &#8211; which needed some fairly complex code to enable priority loading which the client had asked for. Ok &#8211; so once I found this out &#8211; immediately I told the client and said to him &#8211; <em>&#8220;Look, this is going to take a few weeks ( I had quoted one weeks costs at this point ) &#8211; and this is extra time that I am willing to pay for myself to enable the job.&#8221;</em> I am very clear to the client that the additional time I have spent will mean that there is very little room for manoeuvre when it comes to fishing at the end as I&#8217;ll have had to spend so much time off my own back. I will need paying for any alterations. I put this as politely as I can.<br/>
So, the client says &#8211; <em>&#8220;Ok thats fair enough. We want the solution and we don&#8217;t have to pay extra which your not asking for &#8211; great&#8221;</em>. There is no real deadline as its for us, not another client. All well and good. I build the code structure and realise that it requires some pretty carefully thought out sequence for the video and content &#8211; without going to the expense of using an abstract system that would use something like XML that could easily be edited &#8211; and using a class in AS3 etc. So I say to the client &#8211; <em>&#8220;Here are the choices &#8211; go for an abstract class and we can pretty much build anything and in fact you can change the sequence yourself. Anything you like. OR you can have a fixed sequence which will be much quicker and cheaper&#8221;</em>. So naturally &#8211; the client comes back right away and says &#8211; <em>&#8220;No can do on the XML ( in an Email mind you ) we need to keep the costs to a budget&#8221;</em>. So &#8211; Im on the case and start building the sequence. I send them a blow for blow example explaining how the sequence must be strict and alterations will require me re-making the item. So the client says &#8216;yes fine&#8217; without reading anything I have written. Come finishing the job some three weeks late which I had paid for and they were still asking for further alterations. <br/><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-303" style="vertical-align: top; float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;" title="The Walker Agency" src="http://louiscox.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/walker_agency-300x204.jpg" alt="The Walker agency" title="The Walker Agency" width="300" height="204" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-699" / > 
Here ( graphic left ) is the basic layout as an example. Ok says the client &#8211; <em>&#8220;We need this video here and this video here and so on…&#8221;</em>. In reply I say <em>&#8220;Well I sent you this email that clearly says I will need to stick to a specific sequence for cost and speed&#8221;</em>. I outline the email by copy some of its content to the client. Then an argument ensues &#8211; in which I refuse to do the work for free having already done much gratis. The client eventually capitulates &#8211; with a very lengthy and drawn out argument. But everyone is happy and I continue. Three days extra are added to the production. Come the end of the three days &#8211; naturally additional requirements have delayed the finish. The client finally asks for a complete change to the video player and I decide enough is enough and ask for some additional time and cost. Again to cut a long story short the client refuses sign off and after nearly a months worth of unpaid work &#8211; for which I will be getting only just over a weeks pay I decide I have had enough. The client flatly refuses to believe that the changes he has requested are not in the brief. We go back to the brief. He still refuses to accept that its not a change he is asking for saying that the extra three days cover everything.<br/>
Now don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; ordinarily I will spend a bit of extra time covering a job. I don&#8217;t mind a couple of days if it happens and the client is a good one &#8211; pays on time and keeps coming back etc. But here we have such an extreme case that I can spend a few weeks extra getting something right &#8211; and the client totally ignores the good will I have put in to try and lever the exact item they want under the cloak of an estimate. An estimate is exactly that &#8211; just an estimate. It is not a cast iron jacket for cost so that you can be bent over by a client. I try and reason with the client &#8211; they are having none of it and insist that I produce what they want. I try repeatedly to sort it out of court. The client tries the classic tactic of implying I&#8217;m in some way unprofessional because I want to do this and that my work is substandard. We end up in court.<br/>
So, this is small claims &#8211; one court case up I know Im on easier territory. And it proves to be just that. Here are my important points as a freelancer to note. <br/><br/>
1. Get a formal brief by mail or if in person at a studio take copious notes even if that gets difficult. As for a summary of main points by email if they can &#8211; or send yours to them.<br/>
2. Be sure to provide an estimate, and mark it as an estimate or quote.<br/>
3. If the client is insistent on a fixed job cost &#8211; make sure you are totally happy with your time estimate, add some contingency and go back with the cost. If they don&#8217;t like it offer an estimate and cost extra work. Quoting for a job cost is a very risky business because you will have to be very strict with the client about not making changes. Under no circumstances should you end up working for free.<br/>
4. Bill weekly if possible. If its not &#8211; you must be sure to get all the details about payment / the payroll dept &#8211; if possible go and see them with your details and get them to send an email saying they have got them.<br/><br/>
So basically everything you need is at <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/">Government online court service</a>.
<br/><br/>Essentially there is no messing around here. You fill in the form with a precise description of what you have done and what is outstanding. The defendant then gets all the official paperwork. The cost is about £70 which gets added to the outstanding amount. The way it happened for me was the client finally agreed to pay some of the money in a rather rude letter &#8211; saying that I was still wrong. Ok &#8211; I said then lets continue and meet in court. Once you are on track for going to court its not really  worth folding for a few bob off &#8211; its all or nothing with small claims really. Eventually they paid without having to go to court &#8211; without any thanks and that may sound a bit harsh but then I didnt do anything wrong and created exactly what I was asked for so in reality I feel they are lucky I settled when I did. They said my work was substandard and not fit for requirement because they wanted me to work for free which is totally unacceptable from an agency. As I say I hope this helps any freelancers that unfortunately find themselves in the same position. Feel free to contact me regarding the case using the site email.<br/><br/>

Its my express wish to cover these articles to help out freelancers in similar circumstance and not to attack the reputation of any companies I may have worked with. It has to be said that in my experience as a freelancer all my clients are very good at paying and these cases are very much the exception to the rule. Its not that surprising that these cases have occurred during the height of a financial downturn. The problem was I found very little info regarding particularly this &#8211; a major court case &#8211; not small claims. All the information is factually correct as happened to obviously cover myself from any prosecution. This case is regarding a situation where I was owed in excess of £5k by the client, and required the use of a lawyer to negotiate the case, and not a small claims case &#8211; which I have covered in part II.<br/>Ok, so Ive been waiting for a while to write this &#8211; namely until I had taken the case to court and received the payment. Essentially back in April 2009 I was asked by <a href="http://www.montash.com/">Montash Associates</a> via <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/dir/+/Larholt/gb-4573-London,-United-Kingdom">Andy Larholt</a> to create a website for them. I was working with a friend that was doing Copywrite to create the content for the site. We agreed that I would bill my friend and he would in turn bill the entire amount to the client. Ok, great we proceeded with the job. The client had already been to a company based in Brighton who he had thrown off the job because they had asked him to sign an agreement for payment which he refused to. This probably should have set off alarm bells really. So I proceed down the usual lines, produce a design document outlining everything to be created, time scales and a description of functionality. Next the graphic design was outlined. Here&#8217;s is a sample &#8211; if you compare it to the site you can see that even though the client tried to not pay the bill &#8211; effectively saying he was not happy with the site &#8211; he still used the design. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-303" style="vertical-align: top; float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;" title="Montash Associates" src="http://louiscox.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/montash_1-300x214.gif" alt="Montash Asscoiates" title="montash_1" width="300" height="214" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-690" / > The graphic design was sent to the client &#8211; he agreed the design, asked for some Flash header work as seen in the existing site now ( a set of world clocks ) and he liked all of it. That section was paid of at 30% and we all got paid on time. So then no reason to suspect the client would in any way suddenly decide to not pay. <br/>The next phase was started. The company had an I.T. guy that had previously been doing the site. This should have been alarm bell number two, disgruntled ex site builder not happy about new guys coming in. So right from the beginning I ask to the main database that was being used via MySql. Needless to say, despite me chasing and phoning and repeatedly asking the client for the access it was not forth coming. The functionality of the site is all signed off and described in the design document &#8211; we already have the designs so it should really be a matter of just building it. <br/>After nearly a months delay &#8211; I eventually got the client to get all his ducks in a row and get the appropriate information from the right people. Great &#8211; the site is built and everything goes up. Fantastic. We tweak and tweak until it is exactly right. The client sees the first draft of the site as a functional click through and then we apply all the design and add the content. Of course its late due to the technical requirement for the back end. The client is happy with the click-through. The client is happy with the first draft but wants some final alterations. Nothing unusual. Second draft and suddenly there is a mysteriously aloof mail from the client outlining that he is not happy with the site because he has consulted &#8216;an independent&#8217; assessor. Hes not happy with the design ( the one he is still using ) or the functionality ( the one he has agreed to ). Despite a very strong letter of complaint I finally agree to make some of the changes in return for his agreement that he will sign off if I make them and pay. I refuse to do further work unless its paid for and the bill is settled up to date. I really did try and bend over backwards for the client but the basic problem was he did not want to pay for the site as I speculate that his former I.T. guy had offered a site build at a substantially reduced rate. So cut a long story shot &#8211; the client refuses to pay saying the site is late, not fit for purpose and generally poor quality.<br/>Its at this point that most people will just roll over and say &#8211; well its not worth the hassle. This is a tactic employed by many unscrupulous people in business, knowing full well that a prosecution will take much too long and cost way too much. I am here to tell you that if you are a freelancer and you have produced the work as required and the client is just trying it on &#8211; TAKE IT TO COURT. Get a good lawyer and go for it. You did the work &#8211; and nobody has the right to call you work defective when its not. This is another trick employed by unscrupulous business people &#8211; trying to make you feel guilty by saying your work is in some way not good enough. Ok, so assuming your still reading what do you do? I was lucky in the fact that I knew a good lawyer &#8211; and this lawyer was not an expensive, glossy office with potted plants type of place, rather a bread an butter lawyers in my local town who had happened to help me with some property legal matters. This in my opinion is often the way that it goes &#8211; look for a lawyers track record and not how imposing their office is. They might be good at prosecuting major court cases for wealthy clients but when they give a minor case to a junior &#8211; will they be able to cut the mustard? Anyway &#8211; so the buts and bolts of the matter are that a case worth more than £5k has to go to full court &#8211; otherwise it is allocated to small claims, but your lawyer should help you with all this &#8211; as that&#8217;s what they are paid for.<br/> Its worth noting here that it took me a whole year to get to court. Do not expect immediate payment. Going to court is not a quick solution. Small claims is slightly faster so my advice to to just keep billing down to weeks rather than months. We had to pay an initial fee of £500 in paperwork costs to get the ball rolling. Generally both parties will present their case &#8211; an opening gambit. Obviously expect your client to lie if they have tried not to pay &#8211; they will obviously try and get away with it even now. Duly my client tried to explain himself on the matter of subjective matters like design and functionality that was signed off. Even copy that was signed off was brought into question &#8211; all of which was of course ridiculous and I instructed my layer to press ahead. It was at this point that the client tried a dirty trick &#8211; the opposing layers sent word that they would use a clause that they believed we would not have the money to pay the costs should we loose the case. In many peoples mind this would have been a credible threat. To me &#8211; I just saw desperation and pressed the case on. Gradually the client began to realise we were committed to getting a result. Of a total outstanding approx £12k they came back with £2k, followed by £5k and eventually about 3/4 of the outstanding plus lawyers fees. Don&#8217;t forget to include lawyers fees as obviously its s significant amount &#8211; we paid around £3k. A small price given that we might have got nothing from billing of £12k, so well worth doing. Please feel free to write to me about any aspect of the case if I can help more than happy to do so&#8230;<br/><br/>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-189" title="PS3" src="http://www.louiscox.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/PS31.jpg" alt="PS3" width="116" height="75" /><br/><br/><br/>
DO NOT UPDATE YOUR PLAYSTATION. YOU ARE ARE SIGNING AWAY YOUR DIGITAL RIGHTS.<br/><br/>
What to do about charging? thats the question &#8211; whats the profit model? whats the revenue stream? The whole of the gigantic profit making machine that fuelled the post war generations media consumption, stood motionless like a rabbit in the headlights for years as the internet grew from a back-room curio into a fully fledged media monster. Where would these profits come from, who would police the internet?. Open access has become the evil byword to new media profiteers. Now the spell is lifted and they are darting in any direction, desperate to avoid the wheels of progress. Knee jerk solutions are of course rife. Enter DRM, enter Cinavia. Of course conveniently ignoring consumer rights and creating a faster turnover of general consumption is par for the course.<br/>
When I bought my PS3 back in 2009 I naturally assumed that I would be buying exactly what was described to me in all the adds. It was a very open platform with all the bells and whistles. Gradually during the course of the year, its changed from a really neat all in one media player games platform to a Sony Box into which you shove money and things you don&#8217;t want come out. Originally you could install Linux or Gnome. Originally there was no simultaneous sampling of media being played causing problems. Originally you could uninstall software and downgrade if you wanted. Now its all locked down. You can only plug it into the phone line and everything is controlled for you by Sony. Did I buy that? No I did not &#8211; so heed my warning &#8211; DO NOT UPDATE YOUR PLAYSTATION.<br/>
Sony&#8217;s official line was feel free not to upgrade &#8211; but if you don&#8217;t nothings going to work. Ok &#8211; seems fair. The thing that gets stuck in my craw is that there is a &#8216;if you don&#8217;t read the small print&#8217; tough titty policy. The worst culprit for this is the removal of the ability to install a secondary OS. This was removed without any type of real indication to the users because Sony knew full well that it would upset a certain group of consumers. In reality its totally negation of consumer rights. In reality I should be able to send my playstation back to Sony and they should be forced to install the original OS. Because you have the install you have automatically agreed to the way Sony have done things. Hence &#8211; you are signing away your digital rights.<br/>
Then there is the issue of the Cinavia. Sony probably have more of a case for anti piracy here, but even so they should as a courtesy alert the user to the fact that the download alters the OS in very fundamental ways. Since OS version 3.1, the SP3 has had this bit of software that basically has an ear listening to audio played via Disc/mp4 or whatever and if it hears the embedded audio noise it shuts the play down. Its basically to stop the cinema recordings that go on. However of course it will be convenient to also stop the copying of films turned into Blu-ray. Apparently Sony have already run into problems with the network version of films with this encoding type. Im basically of the mind that no matter how much large business tries to justify the use of this type of encryption &#8211; its the artists, its the people working on backroom jobs etc &#8211; its simply the accounts department coming up with increasingly clever ways to plug the revenue holes. The more they do it, the more lone programmers find ways of drilling new ones. Just recently the coding for HDMI has been cracked as well, which will mean further problems for the studios. <br/>
I wish they would just accept that there will be a certain amount of piracy and not try and bugger up everyone&#8217;s equipment by trying to place anti piracy at the top of the list and not delivering what the consumer wants, and we as the consumers are the idiots that keep buying it and not complaining to the manufacturers.<br/>
That said &#8211; is anyone doing anything about it? Yes fortunately for us. The brilliant <a href="http://www.ps3-hacks.com">ps3 hacks</a> where there is a whole collection of software and information. Also <a href="http://christechtv.com/ ">Chris Tech T.V.</a>- a great collection of tips on how to jailbreak the PS3.<br/><br/>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-256" style="vertical-align: top; float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" title="Sad iPhone" src="http://louiscox.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/g_iphone-178x300.jpg" alt="Sad iPhone" width="178" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-613"/>
Continuing the <a href="http://louiscox.com/wordpress/?p=604">saga</a> of fair usage of my iPhone 3G and o2. Quoted direct from an o2 representative, sic &#8220;We are not ripping anyone off&#8221; &#8211; meaning : we are ripping everyone off as fast as we can before the legislation takes hold. The premise is simple. The iPhone 3G was previously only sold by o2 in the U.K. One SIM available and it was the only one that would work legally and practically for all but the highly computer literate. Then Vodaphone came along and started offering PAYG. Now there is the dilema of allowing the phone user to switch from one company to another. For this Apple have to allow the user to &#8216;unlock&#8217; their phone, enabling it to be used with different SIMS, especially those abroad for which people were already dismantling their iPhones. Now, Im a life long Apple user from times when Microsoft had to bale them out, and even before then when Apple had to bale out Microsoft. It will take a very long time for me to start to see Apple as anything but the underdog, but now my previously unmovable faith has started to show cracks. Being tied to one of the phone companies like this has definately caused a lot of grief. Then there is the small matter of roaming abroad and being charged crippling sums for very light downloading. I recently tried to use Brightkite whilst abroad in France using the app. For the three times I used it 02 tried to charge me £10. Now I know that SFR &#8211; the French equivelant of Vodaphone are currently charging £1 &#8211; unlimited download PAYG &#8211; which seems very reasonable.<br/>
I immediately phoned 02 ( on one of the few numbers that are in my allowance I sincerely hope ) to question this. It turned out that one of the charges actually happened at a time when I was asleep! This was brushed off needless to say with the excuse that it was the French network sending the item late &#8211; which of course could not be checked. This is of course a load of rubbish much the same as anything uttered by the spokespeople for the banks. Anything said is with a line toed to not being shot in the foot and is nothing whatsoever to do with honesty until some reliable member of the press picks up on them and starts digging. <br/>
Eventually I got a refund, but it took me threatening a complaint. Now the dilemma of the iPhone 4 looms. 5M pixel camera and HD video footage. Forget the HD video footage, who is going to risk trying to upload a photo via a Euro let alone Asian / American / African upload without trying to organise a new SIM from that country. Any U.K. tariff is totally opaque, except for the companies to say £X amount for 1MB which is a total joke. Different apps use differing amounts let alone the fact that different jpegs cannot be totally different in size. This is a fact that all the phone networks know only too well. Their tariff is design as a short hold to capture the maximum amount of revenue before things go against them. Like the banks &#8211; If only I could set up my own. The rules would be fixed by national mandate. But then, I may as well hope for a second wave of communist revolution. For now, Ill change my SIM for the country Im in, and would suggest anyone else do the same&#8230;

Got to say that the Triumph day event at Mallory park is outstanding value &#8211; £24 a ticket, thats £24!!! and as well as a chance to go round the factory and see all the bikes being made, there is a day of events, stunt riding, etc and to top it off you can see both the Stranglers ( got to be worth it to see them play Golden Brown? ) &#8211; and Mumford and sons who Im not familiar with with I know they are popular. Camping in the grounds of the park is £&#8217;s cheap per night as well. All in all a bargain.

There have been quite a few distopian novels made into films recently and this is very much a second runner to the excellent <a href="http://louiscox.com/wordpress/?p=405">The Road</a> by John Hillcoat. Its definately trying to walk the Mad Max line, the grand daddy of all post apocalyptic road movie films, indeed it even features bad guys on motorbikes and Arab like desertwear. Overall its not a bad film, and not a bad Blu-ray either. There is a lot of attention to getting the mood right. Much of the shooting is done in monochrome or if not a very limited colour base. All this translates nicely. The sound track reminds me of the recent <a href="http://louiscox.com/wordpress/?p=335">I am Legend</a> with sparse track dropped in the middle of nowhere &#8211; and the one notable here is Anita Ward&#8217;s Ring my bell. It is placed in a totally surreal position &#8211; but equally it serves to support the position of the characters refering to a history long gone and should be equally valid &#8211; rather than something we might think fitting. Excellent work.<br/><br/>The film is let down by the near passes to sad as I have to say it &#8211; The Postman. OK, fair do&#8217;s maybe Im a miserable git, and like to see people in a constant state of tragedy but I think its really hard to make a feel good distopia, thats the whole point. But admittedly its a very long way from bad here. It would have so far to go to match the Postman. There are a lot of positive aspects such as Denzel Washington who plays a role outside his comfort zone. Ok there is a fair bit of action but he has to do the kung foo thing which he pulls off quite well and hes also playing the drifter &#8211; not his usual hero. The story is passable adding in well enough to the tempo of the film. Generally its worth a watch, but in preference to the Road, it&#8217;s definately a second runner to me.

If there&#8217;s one thing that sticks in my craw its paying a shit load of money to use my iPhone abroad. I like to use geo-tagged items like posting in <a href="http://brightkite.com/people/louiscox">Brightkite</a>, the exciting thing being that you can go somewhere very remote and log where you have been. Obviously I&#8217;d be expecting to pay to use this service abroad &#8211; especially somewhere outside of Europe, but at £3 / Mb this is ridiculous.<br/>I spend a fair amount of time in France, and Ill be buggered if Im paying a £50 bill just for reading some text email and posting a few items in a blog, as they say &#8211; C&#8217;est des conneries!. So I set out to find out about getting a French iPhone or sim card or whatever. Just to solve this issue.<br/> I came across this article in <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/02/how-to-take-you/">Wired</a> magazine online, which is the meat in the sandwich. Dont get me wrong there are a lot of good articles out there explaining the situation such as <a href="http://madebymany.co.uk/iphone-abroad-usability-nightmare-003607">Made by Many</a> here, and ones telling you how to lower the British charges such as this in <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/blogs/index.cfm?entryid=2065&#038;blogid=4">PC advisor</a>, but what you really want is to use is a local SIM and pay local charges, balls to taking it easy, is this 1990 or 2010. So, as the Wired article says, unlocking the iPhone is the first step. In the Wired article they use a bit of software, but in actual fact I asked o2 and they said they would just unlock it for me enabling me to use a European Sim. I have to wait for it to be switched, which can take two weeks. I spoke to 02 at some length and it appears that the only thing stopping us iPhone users taking a pre paid Sim card abroad is the fact that the network companies are making a killing, and its not in their interests to publicise the fact that you can do this.<br/>That said however I have not actually done this myself yet. Im awaiting the unlocking to go through, and I go to Paris in two weeks, so God willing I may be able to test then, but failing that, it will be July and I aim to get it working by then. Will post further items as and when I get it working.<br/><br/>]]></content:encoded>

When this first came out in 1990 I remember going to see it, and it&#8217;s as shocking now as it was then. It really is in a little genre of its own. Its a bit war film ( Vietnam ), a bit horror and a bit nostalgia human interest with a drugs twist thrown in for good measure. And it comes out the other side well intact.  The basic plot by elliptical method we follow the plight of the lead characters road to recovery from post traumatic stress after his platoon surfer horrendously in a battle. The story then flits between his home life on the streets of New York as a mailman and the battle. As it gets further into the film we begin to realise that not everything is as expected and eventually the film starts to take a very dark and horrific road.<br/>Jacob&#8217;s Ladder has everything you could want from a film really. Great actors headed by a young Tim Robbins. There is a bit of everything all nicely tied together in a really great story. The only slight criticism I would have of it is that it has a bit of a saccharin sweet ending.<br/>As a blu-ray it has huge appeal. I saw the 1080p version and its really beautifully detailed. There is a lot of interior close up smokey mood light scenes as well as very dark horror scenes and broad daylight as well, its all in the mix really. The Blu-ray really goes a long way to re-creating the original cinematic quality. As a blu-ray its really one to buy in my opinion.
