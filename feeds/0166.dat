			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sketchadventure.blogspot.com/">Anthony Holden</a> put the word out on his blog about a <a href="http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/09/07/a-chance-to-do-something-nice-for-a-comics-fan-who-could-use-a-little-niceness/">call to arms</a> for the Internets about a guy named Mike.  Mike is a special-needs pensioneer who spends his days working at a fast food place and amassing an impressive collection of Superman comics and memorabelia.  Cool.  Not too long ago, a dick that worked with Mike pretended to be his friend and feigned interest in his Superman collection long enough to get an invite to go check it out, after which he promptly stole it.  Not cool.</p>
<p>The Internet has saw fit to flood Mike with all new, mostly all original Superman memorabilia to help him get started on his new collection and show him that the world isn&#8217;t full of super-dicks.  Here&#8217;s my effort, done in good ol&#8217; pen-and-ink on real paper.  Mike will get the original, of course.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mutatedjellyfish.net/blog/?attachment_id=394" rel="attachment wp-att-394"><img src="http://blog.worthdayley.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/super-mike-580x800.jpg" alt="" title="super-mike" width="580" height="800" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-394" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been a huge fan of Superman as he is the least-interesting comic book hero of all time.  Invincibility has a way of watering down the drama.  Then again, Superman is kinda boring UNLESS he was real.  THEN he would be the most badass thing anyone&#8217;s ever heard of.  Here&#8217;s hoping these drawings make him a little more real for a big fan.</p>
<p>PS I would be remiss if I posted this without mentioning the likes of <a href="http://joeolson.blogspot.com/">Joe Olson</a> and <a href="http://chrisbattleart.tumblr.com/">Chris Battle</a> whose styles I mercilessly ripped off for this piece.  Standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>

<p>The first assignment in our character design class has always been a french maid, but Ryan got sick of that this time and switched us to other things, so I felt gypped and drew one as a cool-down anyway. Proper arm/hand anatomy seemed to elude me this drawing, and I&#8217;m too lazy to fix it in Photoshop. She&#8217;s based off a photo of silent movie star Anita Page.</p>

<p>It seems that no matter what playlist I check out on Spotify &#8220;Bang Bang&#8221; by Nancy Sinatra is on there. Indie hits of August 2011? Nancy. Popular covers and originals? Nancy. Hip hop classics of 1996? Nancy. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but Spotify LOVES this song, and I got sick of looking at her swagger on the album cover so I stole her soul by drawing a picture of her.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My plans for this environment involve 2 cars: one that you drive (which if I have my way I&#8217;ll have to rig and script in Unreal, which will be fun) and one that you see as part of the landscape so to speak.  Both of these cars are involved in a lengthy race of sorts, so hence the road-warrior-esque modifications and additions they&#8217;ve added, most notably obnoxious antennae used for communication between cars.  Also, as stated before, the period is &#8220;hyper-70s&#8221; so they also need to look the decade.  Here&#8217;s car number 2, which uses the <a href="http://www.ducati.ms/forums/attachments/sport-classic/49102d1244272353-if-your-bike-car-1968_lamborghini_miurap4001.jpg">Lamborghini Miura</a> as a base.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.worthdayley.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/lambo-attempt-01.jpg"><img src="http://blog.worthdayley.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/lambo-attempt-01-300x190.jpg" alt="" title="lambo-attempt-01" width="300" height="190" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-352" /></a></p>
<p>This is obviously nothing more than a doodle, but it allowed me to scribble about and try some things.  It&#8217;s been hard for me to look at a picture of a car and then draw something totally different but still give it the essence of what&#8217;s in the picture.  You can see where I&#8217;m fiddling with giving the Lambo Miura either Porsche or Jaguar headlights, police interceptor-style bumper pads (for rugged-icity), and a Countach-style spoiler in the back.  I also got to fiddle with the shoulders and hips of the car as they are the base of the Miura.  I drew all of this on there and either covered one side or the other to compare looks, or erased and re-drew various elements to try to kit-bash an original but derivitive 70s supercar.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.worthdayley.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/lambo-attempt-02.jpg"><img src="http://blog.worthdayley.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/lambo-attempt-02-300x178.jpg" alt="" title="lambo-attempt-02" width="300" height="178" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-353" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the ortho I then drew based off the above doodle.  Drawing and designing a car has been a completely different experience so far than drawing people.  With this guy, it felt much more sculptural, laying down a line, and then shaving off edges and finding various corners to slice off in order to streamline.  Many, many 70s sports cars had that tapering backend as I&#8217;ve drawn here and in the previous car.  I&#8217;ve retained the rugged bumper pads and added a ridiculously large intake as an element.  I also changed the spoiler from a more modern wing to this retro one.  I found that much of the car looked relatively modern so adding that olde timey spoiler hopefully knocked it back a couple decades.  It worked for Pixar in Cars, anyway.</p>
<p>More to come as I get into blocking out the actual landscape!</p>
