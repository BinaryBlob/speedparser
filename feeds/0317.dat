<p><a href="http://blogs.nlb.gov.sg/esl/files/2010/02/Jean-Tay-Creative-11.jpg"><span style="color: #800080"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-584" src="http://blogs.nlb.gov.sg/esl/files/2010/02/Jean-Tay-Creative-11-214x300.jpg" alt="Jean Tay Creative 1" width="151" height="210" /></span></a></p>
<p><strong>Jean Tay </strong><span style="color: #ff00ff">graduated in 1997 with a double-degree in creative writing and economics from Brown University, USA.  For her fiction, she was awarded Weston Prize for Fiction from Brown, as well as the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> prizes for NAC&#8217;s Golden Point Short Story competition in 1995 and 2001 respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff">Plays produced include “Water from the Well” (1998), “The Knot” (1999), “Hopper’s Women” (co-written with Cindy Koh, 2000), “Plunge” (2000), “Everything but the Brain” (2005, 2007) and “Boom” (2008).  Jean has also written the books for the musicals “The Admiral’s Odyssey” (2005), and “Man of Letters” (2006).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff">In July 2007, Jean was selected to attend the prestigious month-long International Playwriting Residency organised by the Royal Court Theatre in London, where the concept for the play “Boom” was  developed.  The play was first staged in 2008 by SRT, and has been selected as an &#8216;O&#8217; and &#8216;N&#8217; Level literature text for 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff"><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>What are you currently reading?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">I&#8217;m currently reading &#8220;Frog under a Coconut Shell&#8221; by Josephine Chia, and enjoying it very much.  It&#8217;s a very well-written and touching piece of local fiction, which weaves together stories of her youth growing up in a kampong and her mother&#8217;s peranakan heritage, as well as her mother&#8217;s current struggle with Alzheimer&#8217;s.  I&#8217;ve also just been watching a couple of Jane Austen movie adaptations, and have been inspired to revisit some of my dog-eared Jane Austen novels (Emma, Mansfield Park).<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>How many books do you currently own?</strong></span><br />
I&#8217;m not sure exactly&#8230;.Maybe around 300?  Although this includes my husband&#8217;s books, old Economics textbooks and outdated travel guides.   I&#8217;ve probably read most of them over the years, although I have most likely forgotten about half of what I&#8217;ve read. (That&#8217;s certainly true for my Economics textbooks!)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>What&#8217;s unique about your own library?</strong></span><br />
It&#8217;s a pretty eclectic mix, although mostly fiction.  Somehow I&#8217;m not a big non-fiction or poetry reader.  But over the years, I realise that I&#8217;ve been accumulating more and more plays.  It&#8217;s a nice way to relive the plays that I&#8217;ve really enjoyed, as well as to appreciate those plays that I will never get a chance to see in person.  I think that reading a play also gives one a clearer sense of the writer&#8217;s craft and attention to detail, that you might sometimes miss in a live performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>In the event of a fire (touch wood), what is/are the book(s) that you will save?</strong></span><br />
Definitely the Bible, I couldn&#8217;t live without it.  But if I have time, I&#8217;d probably try to grab a couple of my favourite fantasy novelists too, for some escapist reading, like JRR Tolkein or Guy Gavriel Kay.  And of course, Jane Austen&#8217;s Pride and Prejudice.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em><span style="color: #1a07f7">Singaporeans Abroad</span></em></strong><span style="color: #1a07f7"><strong> Writing Workshop<br />
</strong>Saturday, 19 March, 11.00 am &#8211; 12.30 pm<br />
Visitors’ Briefing Room, Level 1, National Library Board</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080">For the avid traveller, why not turn your interesting travel experiences into exciting fictional stories? </span>Writing about your travels is a great way to capture the experience and places you have been to and to share them with others. It entices readers to want to visit the places too!</p>
<p><strong>Josephine Chia</strong>, author of seven published books in Singapore and the UK, will share her writing skills and how she creates stories out of her travel experiences. Her book <em>Isn’t Singapore Somewhere in China, Luv?</em> is a collection of fictional stories of Singaporeans and their experiences abroad. Based on this book, gain insights on some of the stories and how they were weaved together as well as the use of fictional characters in the places Josephine visited.</p>
<p>Bring along snapshots or collectibles from one of your most memorable holidays and we’ll show you how to transform them into a fictional story suitable for publication.</p>
<p>Please bring along writing materials! Due to limited spaces for this hands-on workshop, <span style="color: #0000ff"><strong><span style="color: #800080">please register only if you can really make it <a href="http://golibrary.nlb.gov.sg/Event.aspx?EventID=36095" target="_blank">here</a> or access </span></strong></span><a href="http://golibrary.nlb.gov.sg/"><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong><span style="color: #800080">http://golibrary.nlb.gov.sg</span></strong></span></a><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong><span style="color: #800080">, ‘Singapore’.</span></strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="color: #008000"><strong>About the Book</strong>
Isn’t Singapore somewhere in China, luv? is a collection of short stories
about Singaporeans who are abroad. The stories are not just about places
but also about the people who are travelling, in search of adventure and
emotional fulfilment. Characteristics of the majority of Singaporeans are
worked into the characters, their love of Singaporean food, their sense of
belonging in Singapore and their hardworking attributes.In the stories, these
characters are put into situations that are not their usual fare.</span></pre>
<pre><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>About the Author</strong>
Josephine Chia writes both fiction and non-fiction and has published seven
books. Her first literary break was when she was one of the winners of UK’s
Ian St. James Awards in 1992 for her short story, 'Tropical Fever', which
was subsequently published in an anthology by Harper Collins. Since then,
Josephine has won several other literary prizes and is a member of UK’s
Society of Authors and UK Society of Women Writers &amp; Journalists. She
lives in West Sussex, England.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Choi! Touchwood!</strong><br />
Saturday, 26 February, 9.00 am – 11.30 am<br />
Information Counter, Level 1, National Library Building</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why there are bat motifs in a Chinese temple? Or why is it that cactus is rare in a Chinese home? Join us for a walk through Singapore’s Chinatown – a journey into the Chinese traditions, superstitions, myths and taboos.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800080">Based on the book <em>Choi! Touchwood</em>, this tour takes you through landmarks like Thian Hock Keng Temple, Smith Street, Ang Siang Hill and Sago Lane.</span></strong></p>
<p>Based on their years of research and conceptualisation of <em>Choi! Touchwood</em>, designers of the book will reveal and share fun facts in the world of Chinese superstition at the heart of Singapore’s Chinatown. Explore how the book covered the contrasts of a modern society and traditional beliefs and remind you about your childhood days when traditions, myths and taboos were a big part of your lives. <span style="color: #800080">Bear in mind though that this is not a heritage trail! So come armed with your own stories and beliefs to share with the group.</span></p>
<p>For this tour, we bring you on the first part of the journey covered in the book and leave you to explore the rest on your own!</p>
<h5>Check out <a href="http://www.choitouchwood.com/">www.choitouchwood.com</a> for more information. This programme is jointly presented by National Book Development Council of Singapore (NBDCS) and the National Library Singapore.</h5>

Cake Theatrical Productions turns 5 and this art experiment is all about celebrating a journey, stirring up new possibilities and capturing moments in the realm of the in-between.</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #120df1"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color: #120df1"><strong>heck out more plus the exciting line-up of events at </strong></span><a href="http://www.caketheatre.com/"><span style="color: #120df1"><strong>http://www.caketheatre.com/</strong></span></a></p>
<p><em>The art of living in the in-between</em> is a collaborative art project featuring installation, film, performance, workshops and gigs that uncover the inspirations and fantasies that have catalysed 5 years of works by Cake. Over 5 days, a shophouse is transformed into a hotbed of images, words, sound, strange movement, magnetic encounters and unexpected happenings sometimes way into the night! Wander through the rooms, each flowing and ebbing with exquisite strangeness or come especially for the performance that’ll put the ultra in “ultra Cake mix” or get revitalised in a workshop or hang loose and fancy free at a gig or just come for it all and get a super Cake fix.</p>
