But clumsy people get injured doing everyday things like walking down the street. They also have a knack for tripping, spilling, and breaking things. You should definitely think twice before you let a clumsy person wash your dishes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clumsy person is more likely to trip, spill things, or knock things over. But why are some people clumsier than others? Hear Jason and Amy talk about this problem that they both share.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Yes, even if that person is a fictional character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/i&gt; movie came out in 2001. Now the last film, &lt;I&gt;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part Two&lt;/i&gt;, is finally here. It&amp;#8217;s time for audiences to say goodbye to their favorite wizard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some might not be ready to let go of Harry Potter just yet. Hear Devan and Mason discuss the final film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stepfamilies</title>

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.englishbaby.com/dynamic/standard_lessons/image/0000/0002/2200/2200485_1314308479_812932.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard enough to get along with your own family at times. Imagine having a stepfamily. When a parent remarries after a divorce, it can be complicated, especially if the new stepmother or stepfather has kids, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of an evil stepmother or mean stepsiblings is so common, a lot of movies have been made about it. Just think of the famous Disney cartoon Cinderella, in which an evil stepmother makes her stepdaughter work as a servant in her house! But when you are able to bond with a stepparent or stepsiblings, having a whole new family can be a lot of fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy has a stepmother and three stepsiblings. Hear her tell Devan about what it&amp;#8217;s like to have a step family.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beatriz Recari - Stinger</title>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.englishbaby.com/dynamic/standard_lessons/image/0000/0002/2202/2202959_1314745803_229707.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beatriz Recari is one of the friendliest golfers on the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LPGA&lt;/span&gt; Tour. The Spaniard even knows part of at least 5 languages so she can talk with people around the world. So we were surprised that when we asked her what her favorite golf slang term is, she answered with the very mean-sounding &amp;#8220;stinger.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stinger is a type of shot that stays low to the ground so that it can avoid the wind. Tiger Woods made it popular among male players, but Beatriz thinks it&amp;#8217;s a useful shot for the women too. We asked her to teach us about this term and her mission to continue learning new languages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
