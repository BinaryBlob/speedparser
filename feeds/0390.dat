			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just read another press article, and whilst it expresses coherently some of the great things explored and achieved at Palomar 5, it completely misses the point. It perpetuates the myth of the individual above collective output.</p>
<p>What is it about our society that looks for the individual? That looks to place achievement on one head? That looks to highlight one person as responsible, for a project, it&#8217;s incubation, or creation. History tells us that it is individuals that had influence even when they are attached to movements. Could Hitler have achieved such horrors alone? is Dada merely Dali? even the phrase<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants"> &#8220;standing on the shoulders of giants&#8221; is normally incorrectly attributed to Newton</a>. Individuals generate a focus and a human story, something we can identify with, because our social body is something that we struggle to acknowledge. We see where our body ceases, and we think that this is where the mind stops as well. That we are an island, creating alone. That one man or woman is responsible for great leaps. Individuals merely have the fortune or the nouse to occupy a space that requires filling, if they didn&#8217;t exist someone else would occupy that space (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace">for example even without Darwin we would still have the theory of evolution</a>).</p>
<p>The truth is hard to accept &#8211; that we are an expression of others, the thoughts and ideas of those around us. An interpretation of the ideas that permeate society, a translation, an articulation of possibility. Ego guides us to think of these as the expression of one being, and we respect this because we can then possess the same illusion.</p>
<p>At P5 we went beyond this. It was one of the greatest aspects &#8211; to recognise that such things came from US not ME. Yet still when it is reported, journalists seek the INDIVIDUAL, not the COLLECTIVE.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as &#8220;my idea&#8221;. We must learn to recognise an idea as an observation of what is possible, an expression of what can be. Spotting what exists already as potential in the chaos around us, highlighted by discussion and evolving social awareness within the infinite possibilities of the universe. The individual is merely an advocate of a meme, not the originator.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Based on a previous conversation with <a href="http://www.thewavingcat.com/2009/10/01/tag-your-laptop/">Peter Bihr</a> and being in a <a href="http://www.palomar5.org.">space for 6 weeks where I can do pretty much anything </a>. I decided to play with some basic technology for a change.</p>
<p>The supposition is simple. Express what you want to talk about on your laptop. Grant permission for people to talk to you, give them a starting point and see what happens. Use it in your workspace, your coworking space, your public life, wherever and however you please. To do this follow these simple steps:</p>
<p>1. Download the file below.</p>
<p>2. Printout on sticky backed paper (or normal paper and then tape to your laptop)</p>
<p>3. Cutout</p>
<p>4. Write your personal interest tags</p>
<p>5. Stick to the back of your laptop, above your workspace, on your forehead, wherever</p>
<p>6. Be creative.</p>
<p>7. If you fancy posting photo&#8217;s to flickr, recording conversations started and using the tag #lbubbles I&#8217;d really appreciate it, as it will allow us to track the success of the technology.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Etsy/Folksy/Dawanda meets Instructables</p>
<p>Open and distributed models of product development create an environment in which products can evolve, advance, and be produced as needed, where needed. However designers and innovators attitudes repeatedly return to &#8220;yes very nice, how am I going to get paid?&#8221;</p>
<p>Financial reward does not flow from the idea, it flows from the market. Therefore a system which allows for both innovators, and producers to profit should be market focused. If the innovator owns the market, then they can allow anyone to create the goods and charge for them, but take a slice of the proceeds by managing the marketplace, and making it easier for producers to access the market through them, than it is to undertake the exercise themselves.</p>
<p>If someone wants to replicate the product it makes more sense to service the market, than it does to establish their own market. If a larger company wants to circumvent the system (indeed this is possible even with patents) then they could, however the products they would supply would be vastly different from those supplied by the marketplace (with the marketplace being able to offer a higher speed of innovation, diversity of product, service offering, and localised support). A clever company should recognise that by working with the market they can get the best of both worlds, combining skills to offer rapidly evolving products which benefit from scale of production. See diagram below for an explanation of how such a marketplace might function.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287" title="openinnovation" src="http://jaycousins.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/openinnovation1.png?w=500&#038;h=366" alt="openinnovation" width="500" height="366" /></p>
<p>By “owning” the marketplace, the innovator creates a focal point for their innovation, around which interested customers can gather. Producers can service the customers needs in a way that benefits them, with the innovator taking a slice for providing the virtual space in which this happens. Innovators can also derive profits from suppliers looking to serve both the “Producers market” and the “DIY customers market”. The innovator provides know-how to all parties, and also is responsible for creating the space and ensuring market growth.</p>
<p>I believe it&#8217;s likely that for such a system to work, further elaboration will be required to include further actors &#8211; such as marketeers and evangelists. Also requiring exploration is what happens when someone builds upon an innovation, how is a fair system of reward maintained?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Helping you network, by making you look ridiculous.</p>
<p>Last year at Barcamp Sheffield 2.1, I undertook an experiment in icebreaking. The idea was inspired by tag stickers I saw at an SI camp meetup in London. Essentially the idea was to see whether if we could view peoples interests as tags taking shape as thoughts or speech bubbles, would it stimulate conversation and help break the ice and identify common interests.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258" title="taghats" src="http://jaycousins.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/taghats.jpg?w=500&#038;h=374" alt="taghats" width="500" height="374" /></p>
<p>The idea was seeded at last minute, recruiting volunteers, and extroverts like @thehodge to wear some cloud hats, and start mingling. I also announced what I was doing and where people could get them.</p>
<p>Turns out I could&#8217;ve done with a better production line as people embraced the concept. Whilst not everybody opted for the hats, enough were seeded to give a comic like appearance to the scene in the room. People adapted the clouds to their personalitys, some even creating beautiful illustrations.  It personally led me to discover some hidden  I did interests that I might not have touched upon in the conversation, but I can&#8217;t speak for how it affected everybody. I did however note 2 delegates at Unsheffield who had brought their own ready made tag cloud hats made from attaching speech bubbles to sticks this year.</p>
<p>If you want to do your own test, details on how you can make tag cloud hats can be found below. If you try it out, please keep me posted on how it worked for you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Is it possible to create zones and areas in public, where we feel comfortable talking to strangers?</strong></p>
<p>Post BarCamp Sheffield 2.1 I was mulling over the impact of the event and some of the technologies we implemented. On analysis I realised that a lot of the success of the event arose from the fantastic conversations that occured there.</p>
<p>Most of the people having these great conversations with one another were perfect strangers on arrival. Yet in addition to the scheduled conversations, there were side conversations running on everything from the joy of pure nonsense to religious theology. I began to muse that we had created a &#8220;permissive space&#8221; for these conversations to happen. That when people feel comfortable about talking about their passions thoughts and interest they will do so.</p>
<p>Building on this thinking, I realised that there are other permissive conversational and behavioural technologies within society (ie. things that grant us permission to behave as we&#8217;d wish). For example drugs and alcohol grant permision for deeper or more ridiculous conversation depending on your mood. Yes there is a degree of &#8220;effects&#8221;, but I believe that some of these effects are more psychological &#8211; if we believe it is socially excusable to behave in a certain way because we have been drinking, then we are more likely to do so.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://jaycousins.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/conversational-technologies-tag-cloud-hats/">tag cloud experiment</a>, granted permission to be ridiculous, and set a certain tone. As well as providing easy simple ice breakers for conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Getting to the point.</strong></p>
<p>I believe that it is possible to introduce social permissions into public spaces to encourage conversations between strangers and build communities as a result. These technologies may be simpler than we think, experimentation is required.</p>
<p>I propose that we create &#8220;Conversational Spaces&#8221; in public places. See below for two examples.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-255" title="conversationbench" src="http://jaycousins.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/conversationbench1.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="conversationbench" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254" title="busstop" src="http://jaycousins.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/busstop.jpg?w=500&#038;h=327" alt="busstop" width="500" height="327" /></p>
<p>Text for bench reads. &#8220;Conversation space&#8221; and &#8220;by sitting here, you are happy to have a chat with a stranger&#8221;, text for bus stop is the same, but replaces sitting with standing. If people want to have a conversation then they just follow the rule, if someone else comes along, they both recognise that it is acceptable to chat there.</p>
<p>This assumes that the reason we dont talk to each other is we think that strangers may see us as threatening, or with an agenda, or think we&#8217;re mad and therefore rarely breach this unspoken social contract. The causes of this go deeper, by I haven&#8217;t the inclination to describe them here. If we grant permission to talk to us, by being in such as space, then we can remove this percieved social obstacle.</p>
<p>Yes we may need more rules, we may need less, we may need prompts. But why not start the experiment. It&#8217;s cheap, possibly doable without permission (but better still if publically endorsed) as a form of Guerilla Community Action.</p>
<p>The issue of perverts, weirdos and nutcases: firstly we need to start recognising that most &#8220;strangers&#8221; are not weirdo&#8217;s, perverts or nutcases, secondly these people are in the public domain anyway (and rarely concerned whether you want to talk to them or not). We need to steer away from paranoia paralysis if we are to achieve anything socially beneficial, lets introduce the rules if we need them, and if your scared &#8211; just don&#8217;t sit on the bench.</p>
<p>This idea is not disimilar from the Buddy Bench concept, which enjoys success in playgrounds. http://www.pendlewood.com/early-years-play-equipment/early-years-seating/buddy-bench_184.html</p>
<p>Also it should be noted <a href="http://whowantstobe.co.uk/bench/">&#8220;the democracy bench&#8221;</a> concept arose out of a &#8220;Who want&#8217;s to be?&#8221; event run by <a href="http://www.theps.net/">The People </a>Speak.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Open calendar systems, seem to me to be a massively underexploited gap in the Web 2.0 marketplace.</p>
<p>I have yet to find anything that is remotely good enough, and that fully exploits the opportunities that shared time presents.</p>
<p>Sharing time based information creates numerous opportunities and an open calendar with an intuitive UI represents an incredibly useful tool (google calendar doesn&#8217;t even do basic stuff like let you mark entire blocks of days with drag and drop).</p>
<p>What would a good open calendar enable?</p>
<p>Sharing of events you are attending with freinds (whilst facebook does this already it only does so for events on facebook, also there is no calendar format (which is frickin ridiculous).</p>
<p>Alerting you of relevant events in area you are in, or are going to be in (info relevant to your future time and space).</p>
<p>Time based contact management &#8211; Manage who can contact you and when, create black out zones so you can get work done, coordinate with devices.</p>
<p>Communication syncing &#8211; see when best to organise a chat or a meet up without constantly firing off multiple date/time scenarios</p>
<p>Time sharing &#8211; prearrange times to spend time with people, before you even know what you&#8217;ll be doing. These spaces could be open to suggestions (ie. people could pitch for ways you could spend that time (within predetermined budgets), the lazy way to organise a holiday or meetup).</p>
<p>Flexible work and volunteering management. By showing what you have free and when you can make your self available for work as a freelancer, or for volunteering within the community.</p>
<p>These are just a few things that I would envisage as benefits from sharing time information within a simple open system, I believe as an open source format it would represent numerous opportunities.   With respect to a user interface, i&#8217;m personally inspired by the idea of an annual calender as a circle (taking influence from Eastern calendars) which would make it easy to drag repeat events such as birthdays into future years.</p>
<p>Thoughts greatfully recieved.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been pondering twitter for a while and how i&#8217;d like to use it better (probably like a number of users), being the permanent heretic that I am, never satisfied with the world around me or the tools provided.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to posit an idea on how I believe some of these problems could be solved using a simple twitter hack, which could then be openly adopted by a range of clients.</p>
<p>Whilst reading <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2009/05/a-modest-proposal-for-more-microstructure-location.html">@stoweboyds request to start using / as a location identifier</a>, and also pondering the ubiquitous use of #tags, it occured to me that a lot of the additional user hacks that twitterers employ greatly reduces the already meager number of characters available to tweet. My solution to this is as follows.</p>
<p>A client twitter solution that posts an augmented stream with additional information selected by the user, which would be matched by other client solutions with timestamping and username or @reply selection. This would make it easier to track twitter conversations, but furthermore it would allow for #tag, location, userthread information, and other data I haven&#8217;t yet considered to be transfered adding value without cannabalising the existing twitter feed.</p>
<p>For an example of use see below.</p>
<p>I recieve a tweet of interest to a specific field of interest, I want to retweet but also add a #tag for archiving purposes (obviously first we need a client good at archiving). My client allows me to add #tag information in a completely seperate tweet (lets say a direct tweet to prevent stream pollution) which can be accessed by twitter client and added as extra information at the other end.</p>
<p>Thoughts greatly appreciated.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we&#8217;re now all major shareholders in UK banks, can we hold a shareholders meeting?</p>
<p>Thing&#8217;s I&#8217;d like to put to the table chiefly surround the banks investment strategy.</p>
<p>I have but 2 requests, one do and one don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Do. Develop a strategy whereby a good portion of our funds are invested in areas local to the account holder, with a further % invested at regional and national levels. If we want our economy to thrive, directly connecting our investment in the banks with our economy will surely encourage the funding and development of local and national businesses, and incentivise us to keep our collective spending closer to home. Furthermore we should be connected to these investments (we&#8217;re more likely to promote local businesses if we know how well our fates are intertwined).</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t. Invest our money in businesses that deal in arms and abuse human rights.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for now. Show of hands please.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Get younguns to film old uns talking about what life was like growing up in a particular geographic location.</p>
<p>Will serve to include the old in the digital media revolution and hopefully break down a few of the perceptions that both parties hold. Plus it will create a sense of history around an area.</p>
<p>I was shocked when my mum wrote a musical piece on Halesworth (where I went to school), at how little I knew of the local history, and also how finding out about this affected me emotionally. Stories affect who we think we are, we&#8217;ve become geographically disconnected from our origins. I think Blog the Aged could remedy this.</p>

<p>Further to my previous post on Augmented Content, i&#8217;d like to follow with an example.</p>
<p>The example in question, could remove some of the many issues of media rights that we presently face, if the right profits share systems can be created.</p>
<p>Augmented Broadcasting</p>
<p>Imagine your watching a film and you see something that interests you, you want to buy it, buy something similar, or simply find out about it. Whilst watching, you point and click on the screen, and if you wish make a note to go with your mark (or you can do this after the film, clip, whatever). After you&#8217;ve finished watching, you can return to your tagged items and click through links that will take you to a page where you can buy said item, learn about it, or express interest. Here are the benefits of the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spontaneous gratification &#8211; find out about something as your interest in it peaks, or at least mark it for later</li>
<li>Information Augmentation &#8211; It could be that you want to find out more about the director, the location, the concepts being discussed, the ability to ask the question (even if there isn&#8217;t yet an answer) creates the opportunity to generate deeper knowledge on a subject.</li>
<li>Income streams for creators, mashers, and broadcasters &#8211; if link results in purchase or site visit this can be commercialised in a similar means to adwords. Would suggest that profit is shared, between those that produce, those that edit and reuse, and those who provide the service, and those who add links in first place (it&#8217;s this structure that will present a challenge).</li>
<li>Film can profit from accidental product placement, or simply product use, at home producers can also profit (imagine a clip of you on holiday, links to the destination and results in flight booking).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to go into the mechanics, of how the hell can we do this. Get in touch.</p>
