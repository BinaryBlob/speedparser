They were to become the great Confessors of Christ, the foundation (together with the Old Testament prophets) of the Church. It was vital that their confession be clear then. Jesus begins with a question to set the stage: <strong>&ldquo;Who do people say the Son of Man is?&rdquo;</strong> But this was only to get the disciples thinking, to contrast the worldly opinions of Jesus with the Spirit-revealed faith that they had been given. Then came the crucial question to the disciples: <strong>&ldquo;But what about you? Who do you say I am?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Now in catechism class, a student who doesn&rsquo;t know the answer to a question asked by the pastor will often resort to one of two tactics. The first is to say, &ldquo;God?&rdquo; They figure that this answer will cover two-thirds of the questions. The other tactic when caught off-guard by a question is to lower one&rsquo;s eyes to the table and sit quietly, as if searching the mental databanks. Most students have learned that the pastor only has so much time to get through the material, so he will often move on and ask someone else who has their hand raised.</p>
<p>When Jesus asked the disciples, <strong>&ldquo;Who do you say I am?&rdquo;</strong> ironically, the default catechism answer (&ldquo;God&rdquo;) is the right one -- although Peter&rsquo;s answer was more complete as we&rsquo;ll see. Peter spoke for all of the Twelve this time, but none of them were off the hook. Eventually we must all of us answer for ourselves. Certainly on the last day, it is imperative we know how to answer Jesus&rsquo; question. And I pray that we are ready to answer as clearly and boldly as Peter did. But long before Christ&rsquo;s return, we are asked that question dozens of times. And an answer is always demanded of us.</p>
<p>For example, when we are wrestling with unemployment or the possibility of being laid off and we are concerned about the future, Jesus is asking us, &ldquo;<strong>Who do you say I am?</strong> Am I the not one who fed 5000 men with five loaves of bread and a couple of fish? Am I not the Word through whom all things were made? Am I not the Guest that you ask to bless your food at every meal? Or am I simply a poor carpenter&rsquo;s son that had no place to lay his own head and therefore unable to help you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or when a loved one dies and we are mourning our loss, Jesus asks us, &ldquo;<strong>Who do say I am?</strong> Am I not the Resurrection and the Life? Am I not the one who holds the key to death and Hades in my hand? Or am I just a man who was hung to die on a cross and therefore powerless to give you comfort and hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or when the devil attacks us with temptations to follow the desires of our sinful flesh, Jesus once again asks, &ldquo;<strong>Who do you say I am?</strong> Am I not the one who crushed the head of that ancient serpent? Am I not the one who purchased and won you with my death so that you would be my own and live under me in everlasting righteousness, innocence and blessedness? Or am I simply a rabbi whose teachings are largely ignored today and therefore irrelevant to your personal choices in life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you see that we are often called to answer this question and it is important that we confess Christ clearly. A false confession not only robs us of comfort, it severs our relationship with him. We will confess him clearly and boldly when we remember the content, the source and the result of such a confession.</p>
<p>Many wrong ideas about Jesus exist today -- just as they did at the time of the apostles. Most often people err by considering Christ to be simply a human being. Even if we hold him to be the greatest teacher who ever lived -- or even one of the prophets come back to life as many held back then -- our confession comes up far short of the truth. And it is important for us confess this clearly, because if Christ is anything less than the Son of God, he is just as incapable of saving anyone as we are. Only divine blood shed could clean the sin off of our hearts. Only the death of God could atone for the guilt of all mankind.</p>
<p>Peter answered correctly: <strong>&ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo;</strong> He recognized, along with the rest of the disciples, that Jesus was the Promised Messiah, the Anointed One, the man who was sent by God to rescue his people. But he was also, at the same time, God incarnate. The Son of the living God, the one true God, who alone is to be worshiped and praised.</p>
<p>This is the confession of all true believers. The disciples had declared after the stilling of the storm: <strong>&ldquo;Truly you are the Son of God.&rdquo;</strong> The centurion at the foot of the cross confessed the same to be true when he witnessed the events the accompanied Christ&rsquo;s death. And after the resurrection, Thomas was led to declare: <strong>&ldquo;My Lord and my God.&rdquo;</strong> We confess the same today, in our creeds, in our catechism, in our hymns, in the liturgy, and in our daily lives.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important to note the source of this confession. Jesus said to Peter, <strong>&ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven.&rdquo;</strong> If this were simply the opinion of a man, it would give us no comfort or confident hope at all. Some see the message of the Bible as stories made up to allow little children to sleep peacefully at night. These scoffers find no peace themselves, because they don&rsquo;t believe that the source of the confession is God.</p>
<p>But no one could have made up a story as incredible as the gospel. We heard Paul say in the Epistle reading today, <strong>&rdquo;Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?&rdquo;</strong> (Rom 11:33-34). God&rsquo;s ways are not our ways -- thankfully! The best that man has been able to come up with is that if we try harder to be good, God just might overlook the bad that we have done. But a lifetime of guilt cannot be simply ignored. A holy God will not overlook the transgression of his law. Left to our own devices, we couldn&rsquo;t even imagine a scenario in which the Almighty God would take on human flesh and blood, would take on our guilt and the stink of our sin upon himself. It was unthinkable to us that God the mighty Maker should die for man the creature&rsquo;s sin. And yet God has revealed to us not only this very plan, but also its fulfillment in Jesus Christ. The source of our confession is God himself who has sent his Holy Spirit through the gospel to work this faith in our hearts.</p>
<p>That, of course, is the blessed result of our confession of Christ -- the salvation of souls. <strong>&ldquo;On this rock I will build by church,&rdquo;</strong> Jesus promises. Through the proclamation of who Christ is and what he has done, more and more are brought to faith in him and are joined to Holy Christian Church, the Communion of Saints. That is, they don&rsquo;t just belong to a group or a social club, they are considered to be true saints, holy sons and daughters of the Most High.</p>
<p>This is only possible through the truth about Christ, because we confess that Jesus <strong>&ldquo;was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed&rdquo;</strong> (Is 53:5). For this reason, Christ has the authority to forgive or to retain sins and to give that same authority to those who represent him on earth. <strong>&ldquo;I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.&rdquo;</strong> Because Christ did what he was sent to do, on that basis, the pastor can proclaim to the repentant that the door to heaven has been opened to them, and the person with this confession of Christ can joyfully and confidently claim that forgiveness for himself.</p>
<p>And <strong>&ldquo;the gates of Hades will not overcome it.&rdquo;</strong> Satan will throw everything he has against you and all who confess faith in Christ. He will try to knock you down with despair; he will attempt to pump you full of sinful pride; he will try to lead you astray with the distractions of this world. But the one who remains in Christ, trusting in his promises alone and fed by his word and sacraments, will never be separated from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. When you confess Christ -- when you share your faith with others -- you are leading them to the Rock, to the Refuge, the Mighty Fortress, where all the powers of hell cannot harm them.</p>
<p>What a privilege we have to share the light of Christ with those in darkness. Jesus graciously assures us, <strong>&ldquo;Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven&rdquo;</strong> (Mt 10:32). May the Spirit bless you with boldness and confidence to clearly confess his name. Amen.</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/rss-comments-entry-12918998.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>"Our Identity as Revealed by the Resurrection" - 1 Peter 2:4-10</title><category>Easter</category><category>church</category><category>identity</category><category>resurrection</category><category>universal priestshood</category><dc:creator>Guy Marquardt</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2011 17:24:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/our-identity-as-revealed-by-the-resurrection-1-peter-24-10.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">416643:4578885:11554940</guid><description><![CDATA[This month many young people are graduating from high school or college, and a number of them will be entering into the workforce for the first time. Some of them might go through an identity crisis. For most of their lives they have thought of themselves as students; now they will have different schedules, different responsibilities. An identity crisis can hit us anytime that our life changes and we start to wonder who we are in this world. The young person that moves out of his parents&rsquo; house might have an identity crisis, but so might the parents who have to deal with the empty nest. Likewise for anyone who experiences major loss in life: job, health, or a loved one. But sometimes, we see our identity change for the better. For example, the reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ reveals that our identity has changed as well. The apostle Peter wrote in our text for today: <strong>&ldquo;Once you were not a people, now you are the people of God. Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.&rdquo;</strong> This new identity, however, is tied up in the person of Christ Jesus. We must know who he is first, and only then will we understand who we are ourselves.]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/rss-comments-entry-11554940.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>"A Resurrection Lifestyle" - 1 Peter 1:17-21</title><category>Easter</category><category>Easter</category><category>fear</category><category>heaven</category><category>hope</category><category>resurrection</category><category>sanctification</category><dc:creator>Guy Marquardt</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2011 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/a-resurrection-lifestyle-1-peter-117-21.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">416643:4578885:11422581</guid><description><![CDATA[The story is told that at one point in his career, Martin Luther fell into a deep depression that lasted a number of weeks. One day, his wife Katie came to breakfast in a funeral dress. Martin noticed the way she was dressed and asked, &ldquo;Who died?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;God is dead.&rdquo; Martin began to rebuke her for saying such a ridiculous thing. She waited until he was done and then replied, &ldquo;Well, Martin, from the way you were acting, I thought he was dead.&rdquo; Luther thanked his wife and then carved into the top of his desk the Latin word VIVIT, which means &ldquo;he lives.&rdquo; You see, the reality of the resurrection has a profound impact on our attitude and on our lifestyle. Jesus Christ the Son of God died, but he also came back to life on the third day. The way we live and conduct ourselves is directly related to the way we think about his death and resurrection.]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/rss-comments-entry-11422581.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>"Who Is the King of Glory?" - Matthew 21:1-11</title><category>Jesus Christ</category><category>Lent</category><category>Palm Sunday</category><category>prophecy</category><category>sacrifice</category><dc:creator>Guy Marquardt</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2011 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/who-is-the-king-of-glory-matthew-211-11.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">416643:4578885:11194499</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>The Psalm for today and our Gospel lesson have something in common. They both talk about a parade, a festal procession, some celebrated person coming into the city of Jerusalem. And in both passages, we hear the question: &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; In Psalm 24 David wrote, <strong>&ldquo;Lift up your heads, O you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.&rdquo; </strong>And then the question is asked:<strong> &ldquo;Who is this King of glory?&rdquo;</strong> The answer is found in the next line: <strong>&ldquo;The LORD Almighty&mdash;he is the King of glory.&rdquo;</strong> In other words, this psalm is looking forward to the day when the very Creator of the universe, the one who rules over an army of angels, would come to Jerusalem. But when would that happen?</p>
<p>Fast-forward a thousand years to the time of our Gospel lesson, where Jesus is riding into Jerusalem on a donkey, on a colt the foal of a donkey. The crowds are shouting and singing and waving palm branches, but many are not sure who this person is, so they ask, <strong>&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo;</strong> And the crowds respond, <strong>&ldquo;This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.&rdquo;</strong> But they just as easily could have responded, &ldquo;This is the King of glory&rdquo;. &nbsp;Jesus is the King of glory, who knows what lies ahead. Jesus is the King of glory, who rides into battle for us.</p>
<p>The Palm Sunday Gospel begins in such a matter-of-fact way, perhaps we miss the miracle. Listen again: <strong>&ldquo;As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, &lsquo;Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.&rsquo; &hellip; The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp; Jesus told his disciples more than simply &ldquo;Go find me a donkey.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Go to this village. Here is where you will find it. Someone will question you. Tell them this.&rdquo; His command to the disciples was so specific&mdash;so specific it&rsquo;s really a prediction and a prophecy! He knew. He hadn&rsquo;t set this up. He just knew what was ahead in time. In the grand scheme of things, the location of the donkeys isn&rsquo;t the most important thing to know. Jesus knew it anyway. He knew what he and his disciples would need, so he sent them and directed them to the right street, the right hitching post.</p>
<p>You and I&mdash;our vision is limited. We can only see the present&mdash;and often even that vision is often limited. We have our own ideas about the future. Sometimes we try looking ahead. We see what we think is a realistic picture of our future. Sometimes we paint a very rosy picture for ourselves. You have your mind set on that one thing that will be the key to your success: the new job, the new car, the new project. But after all the dreaming, you learn quickly that your vision was limited, and that God had other plans for you&mdash;good plans, but not what you had planned. God can use that disappointment as a way of destroying your faith in yourself and restoring your faith in him. Sometimes we look forward and the picture isn&rsquo;t rosy at all. You have one setback, and all you can see ahead of you is one failure after and another: shame, loss, disgrace. Then some time passes, and none of it happens. None of it! And you learn that while the events were beyond your control, they weren&rsquo;t beyond God&rsquo;s control. God can use that kind of experience to pull you out of faithlessness, and to repeat his promise to you that he works all things for your good&mdash;even the things that don&rsquo;t seem to be good at the time&mdash;and he makes them all work for his greater plan for our lives. <em>Jesus, our King of glory, does not have limited vision. He sees. He knows. He knows what is in store for you tomorrow. He knew where the donkeys were! He knew what he would need. He knows what you need, too, and he will provide it in his time&mdash;when he knows the time is right for you.</em></p>
<p>But Jesus knew much more than the location of donkeys. He knew what was waiting for him later that week. On his way to Jerusalem, Jesus had told his disciples: <strong>&ldquo;We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!&rdquo;</strong> (Matthew 20:18-19). He knew exactly what was ahead of him. He knew it with certainty. Now if you and I had that same clear vision of the future, and if we knew that such terrible, cruel things were waiting for us, we&rsquo;d turn around and run the other way. Jesus knew what was waiting for him, and he didn&rsquo;t run away from it. He got on that donkey and rode into Jerusalem as a warrior riding into battle&mdash;as a warrior on a rescue mission to save humanity.</p>
<p>The crowds certainly saw Jesus as a hero. As he rode into the holy city, they chanted psalms that talked about the coming Messiah, and they shouted out <strong>&ldquo;Hosanna!&rdquo; &ldquo;Blessed is he who comes in the name of Lord!&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp; Hosanna literally means, &ldquo;Lord, save us now,&rdquo; although even by that time the word was used as a generic word of praise. But if they saw Jesus as a Savior, they didn&rsquo;t understand what he had come to save them from. They imagined that Jesus was there to save them from the hands of the Romans, to restore glory and might to the nation of Israel. But Jesus, the King of glory, had actually come to save them from themselves.</p>
<p>You and I know that Jesus is our Savior, but too often we relegate him to saving us from little problems. We say things like, &ldquo;Lord, help me figure out my taxes in time&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jesus, help me find where I left my keys&rdquo; or &ldquo;God, please keep Cathy from saying bad things about me.&rdquo; But when it comes to spiritual life we say, &ldquo;I know what I believe. I&rsquo;m a good person. I don&rsquo;t need God&rsquo;s help. I don&rsquo;t have to go to church to be a Christian.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s kind of like if you knew Superman personally and he told you how to get a hold of him any time, and you kept calling him for things like opening the jar of pickles, or getting a cat out of a tree, but when Lex Luthor (the bad guy) is threatening to blow up the town you say, &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to bother Superman. Let&rsquo;s see if we can figure out how to stop him ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus, the King of Glory, did not allow himself to be beaten and tortured so that you could be saved from boredom, or from unhappiness, or from shopping too much. He did not suffer and die so that you can have &ldquo;your best life now&rdquo; and &ldquo;live at your full potential.&rdquo; Jesus rode into Jerusalem and let his enemies do terrible things to him because he didn&rsquo;t want to see you in hell, where you had been headed. The Son of God took on human flesh and blood so that his flesh could be torn open with whips and his blood could be spilled in great big drops as a sacrifice on behalf of sinners such as you and me. Jesus is the Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle, and he came to take on the greatest enemies of all mankind: sin, death and the devil himself. His death paid our debt, released us from slavery and purchased us for God.</p>
<p>And God the Holy Spirit now holds out this redemption and freely offers it to all who repent and believe. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much your conscience weighs you down because of a past sin, a past failure. Jesus took it on himself. It is gone. Believe him when he tells you that he has removed your guilt forever. Trust him when he invites you to turn from sin and lean on him and on his loving forgiveness.</p>
<p>This is the glory of the King of glory: not that we sing hosanna and alleluia, not that we lay palm branches at his feet, but that sinners are saved, the lost are found, and those who were spiritually dead are given new life. The King of glory comes to us today, comes to us in his Word, but also in his Sacrament. And in the liturgy, we will sing Hosanna, just as the first disciples did, because we know that Jesus truly will be present, his body and blood given to us in the bread and wine. Welcome him gladly, this King of glory, for he wants to share his glory with you. Now we share in his sufferings. In a short while, we will be with him in the New Jerusalem, the heavenly city. Amen.</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/rss-comments-entry-11194499.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>"We Wait for Hidden Seeds" - John 19:38-42</title><category>Lent</category><category>cross</category><category>death</category><category>evangelism</category><category>faith</category><category>means of grace</category><category>resurrection</category><category>word</category><dc:creator>Guy Marquardt</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2011 03:40:10 +0000</pubDate><link>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/we-wait-for-hidden-seeds-john-1938-42.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">416643:4578885:11150688</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>In Christ Jesus, dear fellow redeemed:</p>
<p>Do you know the feeling of frustration that comes from sharing your faith with someone or inviting them to church, but it seems like your words just went in one ear and out the other? In a way, it would almost be easier if the person would simply say, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not interested.&rdquo; At least then we&rsquo;d know where we stood. We wouldn&rsquo;t hold on to false hopes. But frequently when we talk about our Savior to a friend or a neighbor or a relative, that person doesn&rsquo;t react negatively, but neither do they show any signs of faith. They don&rsquo;t start going to church or Bible study or anything like that. They just go about life as normal.</p>
<p>One of the unfortunate effects of this is that it can cause us to doubt one of the important promises of God. He promises that the Holy Spirit will work through the Word in order to create faith in people&rsquo;s hearts. For example, the apostle Paul wrote to the Romans: <strong>&ldquo;Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Rom 10:17). So when we talk about Jesus to someone and that person doesn&rsquo;t immediately become a Christian, we are tempted to doubt this clear promise of God.</p>
<p>But remember how the Bible defines faith: <strong>&ldquo;Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see&rdquo;</strong> (Heb 11:1). In a way, it&rsquo;s like waiting for planted seeds to sprout and bloom. Do you remember the first time you ever planted a seed? I was in second or third grade and our teacher was having us do a science experiment at school. We were all given little Dixie cups, a bit of soil and a bean seed. The teacher promised that if we were patient, and kept watering the soil, and left the cup in the window, that eventually a bean plant would sprout up out of the soil. Some of my classmates seemed very disappointed when we went back to school the next day and there was no sign of a plant. Some gave up checking the Dixie cup after the first few uneventful mornings. But the teacher told us to be patient, and sure enough, just like she promised, we came to school one morning and there was a green bean sprout sticking up out of the black soil.</p>
<p>Our &ldquo;Person of the Passion&rdquo; tonight reminds us of one of those hidden seeds. Early on in Jesus&rsquo; ministry he was visited by a man named Nicodemus. Nicodemus was a Pharisee and a member of the Jewish ruling council, the Sanhedrin. We read in John chapter 3 how Nicodemus went to Jesus at night in order to ask him questions. The Bible doesn&rsquo;t tell us why he went at nighttime rather than during the day, but why do you think? He must have not wanted anyone to know that he was there talking to Jesus. He must have been either embarrassed or afraid of what others would think. Still, the content of the conversation was richer than anything Nicodemus could have imagined. Just think of how clearly the gospel was presented in that chapter. Jesus talks about the power of Baptism, saying that <strong>&ldquo;no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (3:5). He explains that Baptism is necessary because of original sin, <strong>&ldquo;Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit&rdquo;</strong> (3:6). Nicodemus was even one of the first people to find out that Jesus was going to be crucified, even though it was two or three years away at that point. Jesus told him, <strong>&ldquo;Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (3:14,15).</p>
<p>Jesus gave Nicodemus the clearest gospel presentation that anyone has ever received. And yet after this meeting, nothing seems to happen. Nicodemus doesn&rsquo;t ask to follow Jesus. He doesn&rsquo;t ask to be baptized. He just goes back to his position on the Sanhedrin and says nothing to anyone. It&rsquo;s as if the meeting never happened. His fellow Pharisees continue to persecute Jesus, and we don&rsquo;t hear any real objections from Nicodemus. Oh, once we read about Nicodemus asking, <strong>&ldquo;Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?&rdquo;</strong> (John 7:31) but the other leaders quickly shamed him into silence again. It seemed as if Jesus had wasted his time with this man.</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/rss-comments-entry-11150688.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>"A New Spiritual Attitude" - Romans 8:1-10</title><category>Holy Spirit</category><category>Lent</category><category>selfishness</category><category>service</category><category>sin</category><dc:creator>Guy Marquardt</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2011 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/a-new-spiritual-attitude-romans-81-10-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">416643:4578885:11082626</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>In our Gospel lesson for today, we heard Jesus talking about the type of attitude that his followers are to have. Christians are meant to have a different mindset than the rest of the world around us has. Whereas everyone else is primarily concerned with looking out for &ldquo;number one&rdquo; &ndash; that is, they put their own interests ahead of the needs of others, those who follow Christ are to think like Christ, to have the same spirit as Christ. Jesus describes it this way: <strong>&ldquo;Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave&rdquo;</strong> (Mt 20:26,27). Remember, we&rsquo;re talking about attitudes here. You are not following Christ simply because you feel like others are treating you like a slave. Having a Christ-like attitude means not only that you don&rsquo;t complain about helping others, it&rsquo;s actually your goal, your purpose in life. In the same way that the world around us aspires to greatness and honor, Christians aspire to humility and service. In God&rsquo;s kingdom becoming a servant of others is not a stepping-stone to glory; it is glory. Because that is the same spiritual attitude of our Redeemer: <strong>&ldquo;Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for man&rdquo;</strong> (Mt 20:28).</p>
<p>In our Second Lesson from Romans 8, the apostle Paul further describes this new spiritual attitude of the Christian. This new mindset which is produced by the Holy Spirit first of all looks to what God has done in Christ, and then it reacts to the joyful news in a God-pleasing way.</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/rss-comments-entry-11082626.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>"Jesus Prepares His Disciples for His Passion" - Matthew 17:1-9</title><category>Epiphany</category><category>Transfiguration</category><category>passion</category><category>suffering</category><dc:creator>Guy Marquardt</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2011 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/jesus-prepares-his-disciples-for-his-passion-matthew-171-9.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">416643:4578885:10703122</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Do you have something that you need to do or that you have to go through that you know is going to be difficult? Maybe it&rsquo;s a surgery that you have scheduled, or some project coming up at work or at school that you&rsquo;re afraid of. Maybe it&rsquo;s the fear of getting old and losing control and independence, or the fear of growing up and facing high school and a whole new set of challenges. Maybe you&rsquo;re just afraid of the unknown, what twists and turns life has in store for you.</p>
<p>Did you ever notice that sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to get through these challenges when there&rsquo;s someone else who is even more nervous than you are? Parents can be a little anxious about sending their children off to school for the first time, but they act more confident than they are for the sake of the little one who&rsquo;s looking up at them as they walk through the classroom door together.&nbsp; Or picture the elderly father in the hospital, being wheeled away for surgery. He grabs his daughter&rsquo;s hand, squeezes it, and says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today, on Transfiguration Sunday, we&rsquo;re seven weeks away from Easter, but in our Gospel lesson Jesus was six months away from his death. And he was fully aware of what was waiting for him. Within half a year he would be betrayed by a friend and abandoned by everyone close to him. He would be mistreated by the authorities, cruelly tortured, executed on a cross, and left for dead. We call this the Passion of Christ. &ldquo;Passion&rdquo; comes from a Latin word which means &ldquo;suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, how does Jesus prepare for his Passion. We don&rsquo;t read about him going through a &ldquo;bucket list&rdquo; of things he always wanted to do before he died. He doesn&rsquo;t focus on his own needs, although he does spend a lot of time in prayer with his heavenly Father. But mostly we see Jesus making sure that his disciples were ready for what was going to happen. Jesus was going to die, but he wanted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">them</span> to be prepared.&nbsp; In the verses right before our lesson, Matthew writes: <strong>&ldquo;From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life&rdquo;</strong> (Mt 7:21). Peter didn&rsquo;t take this news well and actually began to rebuke Jesus, scolding him for talking this way. But Jesus in turn rebuked Peter, because he was thinking like a selfish human being who thinks that all suffering is evil, rather than seeing the good that God was planning on bringing about through Jesus&rsquo; suffering and death.</p>
<p>About a week later, the Bible tells us that <strong>&ldquo;Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves&rdquo;</strong> (v. 1). These three were leaders among the disciples, and Jesus needed to make sure they were ready for the difficult days ahead. They were going to be tempted by Satan to believe that God was no longer in control, that Jesus was not the Savior that they thought him to be.</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/rss-comments-entry-10703122.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>"No One Can Serve Two Masters" - Matthew 6:24-34</title><category>Epiphany</category><category>Sermon on the Mount</category><category>kingdom of God</category><category>money</category><category>righteousness</category><category>trust</category><category>wealth</category><category>worry</category><dc:creator>Guy Marquardt</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2011 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/no-one-can-serve-two-masters-matthew-624-34.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">416643:4578885:10629166</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>With the advent of the computer and smart phones and &ldquo;always on&rdquo; technology, there is a lot of talk these days about multi-tasking. Are you a multi-tasker?&nbsp; Can you work on more than one task at a time?&nbsp; Some of us really need to concentrate on one thing at time, but study after study has shown that no one is truly a multi-tasker &ndash; at least not nearly as good as they think they are. Some of us are good at jumping quickly from one train of thought to another and back again&mdash;but that&rsquo;s not multi-tasking. That&rsquo;s just distracting yourself. This is why more and more states are banning the use of cell phones and texting while driving. Too many accidents and deaths have occurred because people thought they were excellent multi-taskers when they really weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In our text for today, Jesus says in his Sermon on the Mount: <strong>&ldquo;No one can serve two masters&rdquo;</strong> (v. 24). He wasn&rsquo;t talking about multi-tasking, but about sharing your heart and the purpose of your life with anything other than God. You can&rsquo;t be a &ldquo;multi-worshiper.&rdquo;&nbsp; First of all, it&rsquo;s against the First Commandment: <strong>&ldquo;I am the Lord your God. You shall have no other gods before me.&rdquo; </strong><em>What does this mean?</em><strong> &ldquo;We should fear, love and trust in God above all things.&rdquo;</strong> But not only is it a sin to try to worship something else and God at the same time, in the end it&rsquo;s impossible. Jesus explains: <strong>&ldquo;No one can serve two masters.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other&rdquo;</strong> (v. 24). If you try to hold something&mdash;anything or anyone&mdash;as dear to you as only God should be, you cannot stay in that state forever. Eventually one will drive the other out. Either your love for God will finally cause you to take this other object of your devotion and put it in second place &ndash; or even throw it out of you life altogether, or finally your love for this other thing, this false god, will cause you to reject God your Father.</p>
<p>This is true in a general way, but Jesus here is talking about a specific application of this truth. He says, <strong>&ldquo;You cannot serve both God and Money&rdquo;</strong> (v. 24). Some of you may remember the old KJV translation which said, <strong>&ldquo;Ye cannot serve God and Mammon&rdquo;</strong>. Mammon was just an Aramaic word that meant wealth or riches. Jesus no doubt used that word Mammon because it just sounds like the name of a false god. (Maybe today he would say, &ldquo;You cannot serve both God and Moolah.&rdquo;)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Money by itself is neutral. It&rsquo;s just a thing that can be used for good or for evil. But money becomes the false god Mammon whenever our attitude towards it takes a wrong turn. You see, the god of your heart, or the master of your soul, is whatever you believe to be the source of your happiness or security. If the only things that really make you happy are things that can be bought, then Money has become your god. It&rsquo;s taken a seat on the throne that was meant only for your Creator, the Lord God Almighty. Your love for money is sitting in the driver&rsquo;s seat and it&rsquo;s calling the shots.</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/rss-comments-entry-10629166.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>"Struggles to Keep the Law of God" - Matthew 5:21-37</title><category>Epiphany</category><category>Sermon on the Mount</category><category>law</category><category>love</category><category>obedience</category><category>repentance</category><dc:creator>Guy Marquardt</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2011 18:20:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/struggles-to-keep-the-law-of-god-matthew-521-37.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">416643:4578885:10583558</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>In Christ Jesus, dear fellow redeemed:</p>
<p>Pastor Mark Cares has an <a href="http://www.truthinloveministry.net/">extensive ministry to Mormons</a> and ex-Mormons. <a href="http://markcares.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/feeling-overwhelmed/">On his blog</a> recently he observed a letter written in to a Mormon magazine: <em>&ldquo;I often feel overwhelmed because I don&rsquo;t feel I measure up to all that&rsquo;s expected of me in living the gospel.&nbsp; How can I learn to rejoice in the gospel when I feel like I may never by able to become or do all the Lord requires of me?&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;All of the various answers given acknowledged the struggle, but failed to give any real help. They said things like: you have to try harder; prioritize your time; take one step at a time; remember that God encourages you; etc. Not a one of them said anything about forgiveness. The assumption was that the person was just going to have to find a way to live a better life on their own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only Mormons and people from other religions that feel that way. Even Christians can become frustrated and discouraged because they&rsquo;re not living the type of lives that they should. They know they should be better people, nicer, kinder, more loving. They know they should give up their sins and their addictions. They know they should spend more time in prayer and in reading scripture. And all too often the advice that they receive from Christian preachers is not much different than what was said in that Mormon magazine: Don&rsquo;t give up! Try harder! One day at a time! You&rsquo;ll get there eventually!&nbsp; And maybe they do improve &ndash; for a while. Maybe they do manage to beat some of the demons &ndash; but they can never fully achieve the level of holiness that they know is correct.</p>
<p>At the time of Jesus, the religious teachers had found a different way to resolve these feelings of guilt. They simply changed the law. It&rsquo;s kind of like this new version of golf called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.flogton.com/">flogton</a>&rdquo;. Have you heard about this? Scott McNealy, the CEO of Sun Microsystems here in the Bay area, decided that the game of golf wasn&rsquo;t fun for a lot of people because of all the rules. So he made new ones. For example, every hole has an automatic mulligan (a do-over), and after your first failed attempt to hit the ball out of a sand bunker, you can just pick the ball up and throw it. The game is called &ldquo;flogton&rdquo; which is &ldquo;not golf&rdquo; spelled backwards.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s one thing to change the rules to a game like golf, but it&rsquo;s quite another to think that you can just change God&rsquo;s holy law to say what you want it to say. But that&rsquo;s pretty much what the Pharisees and religious leaders had done with God&rsquo;s law &ndash; they simply ignored the parts that were too hard and concentrated on the ones that people could actually keep. We would like the law to tell us that we are good people, that we&rsquo;ve done so much good that we deserve to be rewarded. We love to play that game.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a deadly game &ndash; in fact, it&rsquo;s no game at all, because we can easily deceive ourselves into thinking that we&rsquo;ve kept God&rsquo;s law when really haven&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve only brought more condemnation down on our heads.</p>
<p>In his Sermon on the Mount, that we&rsquo;ve been studying during the last few weeks, Jesus sets out to show his disciples that they cannot engage in the game that the Pharisees are playing. In the verse right before our text Jesus says, <strong>&ldquo;For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven&rdquo;</strong> (v. 20).</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/rss-comments-entry-10583558.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>“What Does God Expect of the Ministry in Our Church?” - 1 Corinthians 2:1-5</title><category>Epiphany</category><category>church</category><category>congregation</category><category>ministry</category><category>pastor</category><category>preaching</category><category>public ministry</category><category>stewardship</category><dc:creator>Guy Marquardt</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2011 18:14:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/what-does-god-expect-of-the-ministry-in-our-church-1-corinth.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">416643:4578885:10394661</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>In Christ Jesus, dear fellow redeemed:</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just finished our Stewardship program. We spent most of the month of January reviewing the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of Christian stewardship &ndash; that is, the reason why we offer ourselves in service to God is because of the wonderful blessings he has showered on us only because of his grace and mercy. Last week on Commitment Sunday we finished up with the &ldquo;what&rdquo; of Christian Stewardship &ndash; what it is that we commit to God&rsquo;s service. We brought before the Lord our promises to use our time, talent and treasures for his glory throughout the coming year. We are committed to serving the Lord who has served us by giving his life and continues to serve us by giving us his Word and Sacrament.</p>
<p>But the Time &amp; Talent sheets we collected aren&rsquo;t just about finding ways to keep God&rsquo;s people busy. And the offerings you pledged to give aren&rsquo;t just so you don&rsquo;t waste your money on something foolish. No, the next part of Christian stewardship could be called the &ldquo;how&rdquo; &ndash; how should we serve the Lord. Since we are but stewards, managers of these gifts which the Lord has put into our care, it&rsquo;s vitally important that we submit to his will, that we ask the question: <strong>&ldquo;What Does God Expect of the Ministry in Our Church?&rdquo;</strong> Our text for today from 1 Corinthians 2 isn&rsquo;t going to give us a roadmap of all the details, but it reveals the priorities that the Lord of the Church would have us focus on as a Christian congregation.</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://christ-lodi.org/sermons/rss-comments-entry-10394661.xml</wfw:commentRss></item></channel></rss>
