			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://edreach.us/2011/09/19/the-coming-expansion-of-k12-online-learning/edreach-online/" rel="attachment wp-att-6553"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6553" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/EdReach-Online.png" alt="" width="178" height="177" /></a>K-12 online education has grown at a rate of 30% annually. Hybrid classrooms (a blend of online and face-to-face instruction) has also begun to gain traction in main-stream K-12 education. Despite these indicators, two factors continue to hold back the growth of online learning at the K-12 level:</p>
<p>1. State and federal education policy was written before online learning was a thought. Current policies, such as seat time requirements and funding models, unintentionally retard growth in K-12 online learning.</p>
<p>2. Like the music and newspaper industries, traditional publishers have been a significant obstacles to improvements in online learning. In an effort to protect their existing multi-billion dollar market, few of the large publishers have produced any innovative products for the online learning sector.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the foundations of these two roadblocks are beginning to crumble, potentially paving the way for a rapid expansion of online learning opportunities for K-12 students.</p>
<p>This past week, <a href="http://www.pearsoned.com/" target="_blank">Pearson Education</a>, the world&#8217;s largest publication company, purchased <a href="http://www.connectionsacademy.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Connections Academy</a>, an online school and content provider for 21 states and over 40,000 students, for $400 million. Will Ethridge, CEO of Pearson North America, <a href="http://www.pearsoned.com/blog/pearson-acquires-connections-education/" target="_blank">said</a>, &#8220;We see Connections Education as highly complementary to our own business, and it provides an opportunity for developing new models of instruction and increasing the effectiveness of Pearson&#8217;s global educational programs.&#8221; This deal follows in the footsteps of significant investments in online learning technology from the likes of <a title="Is EdTech the Answer? Rupert Murdoch thinks so!" href="http://edreach.us/2011/06/13/is-edtech-the-answer-rupert-murdock-thinks-so/">Rupert Murdoch</a>.</p>
<p>This purchase signals a change in Pearson&#8217;s corporate vision and makes them a powerful force in the online learning market, one that can take on Florida and North Carolina&#8217;s virtual programs which account for 96% of the online learning market. The modest investment made by Pearson (2010 earnings were <a href="http://www.corporateinformation.com/Company-Snapshot.aspx?cusip=705015105" target="_blank">$8.7 billion</a>) could potentially start a good &#8216;ol fashioned &#8220;arms race&#8221; as other large publishers stake a piece of the online learning sector. Be on the lookout for acquisitions by McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in the near future.</p>
<p>The second recent development that signals a change in acceptance of online learning is the <a href="http://virtualschooling.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/id-ed-board-votes-to-require-online-classes-idaho-statesman/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+VirtualSchoolMeanderings+%28Virtual+School+Meanderings%29" target="_blank">recent decision</a> by the Idaho State Board of Education to require the class of 2016 to complete at least 2 credits virtually in order to graduate. Board Secretary Don Soltman commented, &#8221;We live in a digital age and we must do right by our students and give them an opportunity to learn in this environment before they go on to their post-secondary education.&#8221; Experience in online learning is becoming an accepted form of college preparation as more and more higher-ed courses are being conducted virtually.</p>
<p>Idaho joins three other states (Alabama, Michigan, and Florida) that have also mandated that high school graduates have an online learning experience. What makes Idaho different is the specification that students take two credits online whereas the other states only require an online learning &#8220;experience&#8221; or a single course. Indiana is also <a href="http://virtualschooling.wordpress.com/2011/09/15/in-schools-chief-backs-online-class-requirement/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+VirtualSchoolMeanderings+%28Virtual+School+Meanderings%29" target="_blank">close to </a><a href="http://virtualschooling.wordpress.com/2011/09/15/in-schools-chief-backs-online-class-requirement/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+VirtualSchoolMeanderings+%28Virtual+School+Meanderings%29" target="_blank">enacting</a> a similar requirement.</p>
<p>The virtual learning tidal wave is gaining momentum. As online learning become more popular, there will undoubtedly be a shortage of qualified and experienced teachers presenting a tremendous opportunity for pioneering educators.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you teach or lead any grades K-8 then a must have resource on your shelf should be the <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Continuum of Literacy Learning</span> by Fountas and Pinnell.  If you study and compare the continuum with the Common Core you will see a grand correlation.  Fountas and Pinnell offer free PDF correlation guides, scroll down toward the bottom of the page: <a href="http://www.heinemann.com/fountasandpinnell/supportingMaterials.aspx">The Continuum and The Common Core.</a></li>
<li>An article that I found incredibly enlightening was in the March 2011 issue of ASCD&#8217;s Educational Leadership.  The article <a href="http://www.educationalleadership-digital.com/educationalleadership/201103/?pg=18&amp;pm=2&amp;u1=friend">&#8220;Building on the Common Core&#8221;</a> is  worth the read!  You can access it <a href="http://www.educationalleadership-digital.com/educationalleadership/201103/?pg=18&amp;pm=2&amp;u1=friend">here</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure you bookmark the Common Core initiative website: <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/">http://www.corestandards.org</a>/; there is a plethora of resources on this site.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://touchautism.com/" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-6480 aligncenter" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Touch-Autism.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="112" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://touchautism.com/" target="_blank">Touch Autism</a> is a two person team that is dedicated to making the best technological apps for autism, Down syndrome and other special needs.  The Touch Autism Team is comprised of Jenny Winningham, a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, and Tomas Krones, a software engineer.  They have recently given the EdCeptional crew promo codes to giveaway for 4 of their wonderful apps, described below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Touch Tutorial</strong>  ($2.99 | <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touch-tutorial-elderly-autism/id433039466?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes App Store</a>) - <span style="color: #ff0000"><em><strong>2 codes available</strong></em></span></p>
<p><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-6506 alignleft" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/TouchTutorial-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="120" />Touch Tutorial was designed to teach users who have had minimal or no experience with iOS devices how to use touch screens.  This application uses easy to understand language and icons to teach foundational skills and then builds upon those skills to help users learn the common gestures necessary to use iOS devices.  A “gesture” is touching, tapping, holding or sliding your finger(s) along a screen in a specific way to communicate a command to your device.</p>
<p>This tutorial will introduce several common gestures.  A different target, or symbol will be used to prompt each different gesture.  These targets will be introduced with their corresponding gestures.  Every time the unique target appears the user has to tap, touch or slide it with the gesture associated with it.  After each target is introduced, the user will get a chance to hone his or her new skills by playing a game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Touch Trainer  </strong>($6.99 | <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touch-trainer-autism-special/id424128577?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes App Store</a>) - <span style="color: #ff0000"><em><strong>2 codes available</strong></em></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6507" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/TouchTrainer-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="120" /> Touch Trainer is a simple cause-and-effect app.  This app was designed as a way to use errorless learning to teach the prerequisite skills necessary for accessing touch screen technology (i.e. auditory and visual discrimination skills, &#8220;tapping&#8221; skills, and basic awareness of cause-and-effect).   This app plays music and shows a simple animation whenever the correct place on the screen is tapped.  Touch Trainer provides immediate and consistent feedback,  allows learner to be in control and move forward at their own pace, and provides repetitive practice of basic skills in a fun way.  This app has seven levels in which the buttons get progressively smaller.  Caregivers are able to choose how many correct responses move the learner onto the next level as well as the length (in seconds) of audio/visual/vibrating reinforcer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Turn Taker  </strong>($4.99 | <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/turn-taker/id399113420?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4" target="_blank">iTunes App Store</a>) - <span style="color: #ff0000"><em><strong> 2 codes available</strong></em></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6508" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/TurnTaker-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>Turn Taker uses visual and/or audio cues to easily facilitate turn taking and/or sharing.  Learning to appropriately take turns is imperative to create and maintain social relationships.  Children with autism may not act on play materials or imitate peer actions without cues, external facilitation, or instruction; however, with prompting and instruction, play skills can improve.  Caregivers are able to set the time of each child&#8217;s turn. This is an important feature, as it makes it easier to introduce the concept of “sharing”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preference Assessment  </strong>($6.99 | <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touch-trainer-autism-special/id424128577?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes App Store</a>) -<span style="color: #ff0000"><em><strong> 1 code available</strong></em></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6512" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/PreferenceAssessment-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="120" /> Preference Assessment app was designed to make it easy for anyone to effectively and scientifically determine their child&#8217;s or students&#8217; preferences.  Reinforcement (Preference) Assessments are a key component of a BIP (behavior intervention plan) or FBA (functional behavior assessment).  In order to strengthen a target behavior, it is necessary to know which items or activities will act as the strongest reinforcers.  This app is research-based and features descriptions of all types of preference assessments, a timer to determine the end of trials, as well as specific instructions and visuals to help set up and run the assessment.  Once the assessment is complete, the Preference Assessment app automatically calculates the percentage of times each item was selected in which it was available, and will present this information in an easy-to-read bar graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>FREE app:  </strong></span><strong>Autism Apps </strong> (FREE | <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autism-apps/id441600681?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes App Store</a>)</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6518" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/AutismApps-150x150.png" alt="" width="120" height="120" />Autism Apps is simply a comprehensive list of apps that have been found to be effective in use with and by people diagnosed with autism, Down syndrome and other special needs.  It includes links to any available information that can be found for each app.  The apps are separated into over 30 categories and the descriptions are all searchable, making them easy to find and download.</p>

The worksheet below is what I have put together for my students.  I want this to be a family and classroom discussion.  It will not be easy for those who answer the questions below, but the important discussions are never simple.  Please let me know your thoughts about the assignment and if you have any suggestions.  There are many ways this can be taught and I am hoping a civil dialogue can occur within the EdReach community.</p>
<p>One important topic that I do not ask concerns religious toleration.  This is a difficult topic for the age I teach, 6th grade.  As the year goes on I teach about the five major religions and I will refer back to 9-11 for examples of religious intolerance.</p>
<p>I hope this post will help those of you out there contemplating teaching about 9-11.  If you would like to use all or part of what I created, that is fine.  All I ask is that you credit me and EdReach.   Zack Gilbert &#8211; <a href="http://edreach.us/">http://edreach.us/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>September 11, 2001</strong></em></p>
<p>As all of you know, the 10th anniversary of 9-11 is on Sunday.  This is a difficult time for all Americans, but it is difficult to understand for those who are young. Your children were born around the year 2000 and have never known life to be different as it was before that fateful day.  I have created an optional assignment for your child and I will understand if you do not participate.  I do hope that you will have discussions at home concerning September 11, 2001, as it is important to our nation’s history.  Please contact me if you have any questions.</p>
<p>You can ask the questions below to any family members.  (parents, grandparents, older siblings, etc&#8230;)  Use one worksheet for each person.</p>
<p>1.      Are there historical events in your life where you can remember exactly where you were when you heard the news?  How did these events impact you?</p>
<p>2.      What was life like before September 11th?  What changes have you seen after this event?</p>
<p>3.      What important lessons can we teach our children about September 11th?  Why is important to remember this date?</p>
<p>4.      Do you have anything else you would like to share?</p>
<p>Please contact me if there is anything you would like to discuss.</p>
<p>Thank you for your assistance in this questionnaire.  Keeping history alive is very important, especially when the personal stories come from your own family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Mr. Gilbert</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6410" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/NETS-224x300.jpg" alt="NETS" width="224" height="300" />With the dramatic advancements in technology over the last decade, classroom-based technologies have exploded throughout education. However, in many districts, technology is often taken for granted. That is not to say that teachers and students do not appreciate the technology within their schools. Both teachers and students <em>use</em> technology in schools everyday, but often focused instruction in the appropriate use of technology is simply not the intended goal for educators. For many teachers, classroom and lab technologies are <em>leveraged</em> to replace a previous instructional choice or utilized to achieve a content goal without thought or regard for the skills students need to use the technology itself or for their future. Additionally, there is the very real (but false) belief that because student &#8220;have grown up with technology&#8221; they have the skills to use it effectively.</p>
<p>To help provide guidance for educators around the world, in 1998 the <a href="http://www.iste.org/welcome.aspx" target="_blank">International Society of Technology in Education</a> (ISTE) released the first set of standards for technology use by students: <a href="http://www.iste.org/Libraries/PDFs/NETS_for_Students_1998_Standards.sflb.ashx" target="_blank">NETS</a>. However, even though that first set of technology standards was released 13 years ago there are many educators today who are still unaware they exist or were last updated regarding students in <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/nets-for-students/nets-student-standards-2007.aspx" target="_blank">2007</a>, teachers in <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/nets-for-teachers/nets-for-teachers-2008.aspx" target="_blank">2008</a>, and created for administrator in <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/nets-for-administrators/nets-for-administrators-sandards.aspx" target="_blank">2009</a>. To help bring NETS into focus, I will be delving further into each of the Standards over the next few weeks. Here is a brief overview of each Set of Standards:</p>
<p><strong>National Educational Technology Standards for Students (<a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/nets-for-students.aspx" target="_blank">NETS-S</a>)</strong>: <strong><span style="color: #993366">Digital-Age Learning</span></strong></p>
<p>As technology permeates our society, NETS-S was built around students not only becoming good digital citizens, but to foster creativity, leverage higher order thinking, increase problem solving skills, as well as develop an appreciation for and interaction with others on a global scale.</p>
<blockquote><p>ISTE&#8217;s <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/nets-for-students/nets-student-standards-2007.aspx">NETS for Students (2007)</a> help students prepare to work, live, and contribute to the social and civic fabric of their communities.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>National Educational Technology Standards for Teachers (<a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/nets-for-teachers/nets-for-teachers-2008.aspx" target="_blank">NETS-T</a>)</strong>: <strong><span style="color: #993366">Digital-Age Teaching</span></strong></p>
<p>Originally developed to assist teachers with applying technology in education, NETS-T has evolved through the 2008 refresh to define a framework for creating an environment of digital learning for students. The key tenants for NETS-T encompass: Becoming a facilitator for student creativity, developing &#8211; fostering and modeling digital experiences and learning, and promoting digital citizenship and responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>National Educational Technology Standards for Administrators (<a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/nets-for-administrators.aspx" target="_blank">NETS-A</a>)</strong>: <strong><span style="color: #993366">Digital-Age Leadership</span></strong></p>
<p>Open, focused and effective leadership is key in any endeavor, however, it is even more pivotal where technology is concerned. NETS-A was defined to assist administrators with creating a vision for technology as well as defining and fostering dynamic learning communities.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Integrating technology throughout a school system is, in itself, significant systemic reform. We have a wealth of evidence attesting to the importance of leadership in implementing and sustaining systemic reform in schools. It is critical, therefore, that we attend seriously to leadership for technology in schools.&#8221;</em>           — Don Knezek, ISTE CEO</p></blockquote>
<p>As technology continues to expand and evolve, ISTE&#8217;s NETS initiative will also continue to expand and evolve to be able to provide insight, leadership, and a framework for learning, educating, and visioning in our emerging global society.</p>
<p>I hope you will join me next week for: NETS-S Infused Learning</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I want to learn about a new topic or be informed on issues that are important to me, I look for blogs and people to add to my PLN. This year I am focusing a lot on distance learning as I help launch a new online program for my school. Here are a few key sources of information and inspiration that I draw upon:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.onlineuniversities.com/" target="_blank"><span>1. <span>OnlineUniversities</span>.com</span></a>: Blogger Justin W. Marquis shares information about online learning in link-rich posts.</p>
<p><a href="http://disruptingclass.mhprofessional.com/apps/ab/" target="_blank">2. Disrupting Class</a><span>: Clayton Christensen and Michael Horn post infrequent, but insightful thoughts on current trends in online learning. These guys have a really good handle on the pulse of virtual education at all levels.</span></p>
<p>3. <a href="http://virtualschooling.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Virtual School Meanderings</a>: Blogger <a href="http://www.michaelbarbour.com" target="_blank">Michael Barbour</a> authors one of the most regularly updated blogs on online learning that I have found. There is little that goes on in this sector of education that Barbour doesn&#8217;t pick up and comment on. This is a go-to blog.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://theelearningcoach.com/" target="_blank"><span>The <span>eLearning</span> <span>Coach</span></span></a>: This blog provides a refreshingly different take on distance learning as it it focuses on designing courses for use in a business setting. Author <a href="http://theelearningcoach.com/about/" target="_blank"><span>Connie <span>Malamed</span></span></a> provides very practical advice on designing effective courses.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://gettingsmart.com/blog/" target="_blank"><span>Getting Smart (formerly <span>EdReformer</span>)</span></a>: an excellent source for policy information related to online and virtual education in the United States.</p>

We wondered: can we create conversation around making the tools we use- more intuitive?  So, we got together with <a href="http://EasyBib.com">EasyBib.com</a> (since they&#8217;re so good with Internet research) and they&#8217;re joining us for #EdReach chat! Here&#8217;s the scoop: <em></em></div>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Simplifying Internet Research: An #EdReach Chat with EasyBib</strong></div>
<div><strong>When</strong>: Sunday, August 28th, at 8pm EST/ 7pm CST</div>
<div><strong>Where</strong>: Get on Twitter Search <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23edreach">here</a>: or come right here to <a href="http://edreach.us">EdReach.us</a> to join the EdReach contributors, <a href="http://Easybib.com">Easybib</a> creators, and you-  as we discuss the current state of researching on the web. How do we make research fun for students? How does the Internet help us to do research intuitively? What problems have we had with students that we can prevent with the right tools? Let’s answer these questions and more, as we collaborate and highlight your innovations and ideas. Should be fun!</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Awesome! We&#8217;ll see you Sunday night. Please let your neighbor know- tweet this out!  [tweetbutton]<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://edreach.us/2011/08/22/online-learning-primer/online-learning-primer-001-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-6203"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6203" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/online-learning-primer.0011-300x151.jpg" alt="Online Learning Primer" width="300" height="151" /></a>There is a lot of confusion and misunderstanding surrounding online learning. I am currently in the process of launching a virtual school and have daily conversations with people regarding our program. Here are some comments I have received:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;So you have webcams setup in all of your traditional classrooms and students from around the world just watch what&#8217;s going on on the real class?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is my kids just going to sit in front of his computer all day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone has to get online at a certain time to watch the teacher deliver the lesson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do students ever get to interact with a teacher or their classmates?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>These comments, and many others that I have received underscore the limited exposure that most people have toward online learning and some of the misconceptions that exist. It&#8217;s my goal to educate them on the possibilities of online learning. Here&#8217;s a quick primer.</p>
<p><strong>Synchronous Learning</strong>: This model of instruction requires students to be present in front of their computing device at a specified time to participate in the learning activity for the day. This is often lecture or other forms of direct instruction. The benefit to this type of arrangement is the ability to ask questions of the instructor in a real-time setting. For the instructor, they have the opportunity to better assess the understanding of their students.  The downside to this method is that it restricts the flexible nature of online learning by requiring students to be present at a specific time. It also becomes very challenging when dealing with students from multiple time-zones, some of which can have a 12  hour time difference.</p>
<p><strong>Asynchronous Learning:</strong>  This method of instruction has become the dominant form of online learning because it allows students to learn when and where they choose. Instruction is accessed on-demand through recorded and web-based information. Students are given a list of assignments to complete by a certain date and then have the flexibility to schedule study times around their personal needs. The weakness of this method of instruction is that obtaining personal help from the instruction requires communication and the scheduling of virtual meetings. Instructors also have a greater challenging in tracking student understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Management System (LMS):</strong> The LMS is a web-based software application that manages course content, assessments, student progress. The LMS includes many resources such as the digital course text, a calendar with assignment deadlines, discussion boards, a drop-box for submitting files to the instructor, and a resource section with the course syllabus and assignment documents. Most LMS systems include the ability to give tests, chat with teachers and students, send messages to the course instructor, and see grades. Popular LMS systems include <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/" target="_blank">Blackboard</a>, <a href="http://moodle.com/" target="_blank">Moodle</a>, <a href="http://brainhoney.com/" target="_blank">BrainHoney</a>, and <a href="http://www.haikulearning.com/" target="_blank">Haiku</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Student Information System (SIS):</strong> The SIS is the central reporting tool for a virtual school and acts much like a traditional guidance counselor. The SIS accepts student applications and enrollments and manages graduation requirements, transcripts, and report cards. Many SIS systems include powerful reporting tools that allow school administrators and parents to obtain detailed information about the progress of their students. Popular SIS systems include <a href="http://www.geniussis.com/" target="_blank">Genius</a>, <a href="http://www.blackbaud.com/products/school/sis.aspx" target="_blank">BlackBaud</a>, and <a href="http://opensis.com/" target="_blank">Open SIS</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Classroom (VC)</strong>: The virtual classroom is where real-time, synchronous communication takes place. The VC is a teleconferencing platform that typically includes audio, video, chat, screen sharing, and a white-board. In a synchronous school, the VC is the place where students gather to participate in a lesson, In an asynchronous model, the VC is where students and teachers will meet to work through challenging problems and get additional help on a lesson. Popular VC systems include <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Collaborate/Overview.aspx" target="_blank">Elluminate</a> (now Blackboard Connect), <a href="http://connect.brand.us.sem.adobe.com/content/try?sdid=IEASO&amp;skwcid=TC|22191|adobe%20connect||S|e|5894715262" target="_blank">Adobe Connect</a>, <a href="http://www.gotomeeting.com/fec/" target="_blank">GoToMeeting</a>, <a href="http://vivu.tv/vivuweb/" target="_blank">ViVu.tv</a> and <a href="http://www.webex.com/" target="_blank">WebEx</a>. <a href="skype.com" target="_blank">Skype</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/res/talkvideo/hangouts/" target="_blank">Google+ Hangouts</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/videocalling" target="_blank">Facebook Video Chat</a>, and <a href="http://www.oovoo.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">OoVoO</a> can also be used, although they are not as full-featured.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media:</strong> One of the frequent concerns that parents and students have about learning online is the perceived lack of social interaction with teachers and peers. While this doesn&#8217;t happen as naturally in an online environment as in a traditional classroom setting, there are many ways to intentionally include this aspect into an online school. This aspect of online learning is fairly new (last 3-4 year), but is quickly growing. A few companies with innovative products in this market include <a href="http://www.edmodo.com/" target="_blank">Edmodo</a>, <a href="https://www.schoology.com/home.php" target="_blank">Schoology</a>, and <a href="http://www.socialcast.com/" target="_blank">Social Cast</a>.</p>

<p>Every year school leaders spend hours developing schedules that should, in essence, work like clockwork.  This scheduling dilemma is a task that can go smoothly, or can be a nightmare for any school leader.</p>
<p>Right now I am in the thick of the scheduling jungle; I&#8217;m working on several different schedules for our special education staff and assistants.  I&#8217;m stoked about this challenge and I am excited to collaboratively work on this with colleagues in an effort to move students continuously forward!  I&#8217;d like to share five ways school leaders can avoid scheduling nightmares.</p>
<p>1.  Don&#8217;t work solo!</p>
<p>It is important that you work collaboratively with your colleagues.  In my experience no matter how many times you look at what you think is a final draft of a schedule a colleague can come in and find what you are not seeing.  Working with your staff collaboratively on schedules creates shared buy-in and builds capacity toward your vision and goals.</p>
<p>I think it is also important that you look for advice from those who have been scheduling for years.</p>
<p>2.  Use collaborative tools for schedule building.</p>
<p>The tools you use can make all the difference when working on a schedule.  I would consider using any of these tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar </a></li>
<li><a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com">Google Spreadsheets</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.zoho.com/calendar/help/user-guide/about-zoho-calendar.html">ZoHo Calendar </a></li>
<li><a href="https://sheet.zoho.com">ZoHo Sheet</a></li>
<li>Networked Outlook Calendars</li>
</ul>
<div>I like the idea of anything that will allow users to visually see the schedule and simultaneously collaborate with each other.  Personally, I like to setup a frame/template in Google spreadsheets and then share that with my collaborators.  Check out the Google Template gallery for some <a href="https://docs.google.com/templates">templates</a>.  If portions of your schedule require staff to create appointments on an ongoing basis look at the new <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-appointment-slots-in-google.html">appointment slots feature in Google Calendar</a>, or think about using <a href="http://youcanbook.me/">youcanbookme.com</a>.</div>
<div>3.  Think about your priorities!</div>
<p>As you work on schedules think about what are the non-negotiable things that must be in place, then begin to work around those.  For example, let&#8217;s say your school has interventions and you have a grade level that will have a significant amount of students in intervention, block the time off first when you will have the most available staff and then work around that.</p>
<p>4.  Share, communicate, and consider feedback</p>
<p>When you share a schedule with the key stakeholders involved it is important to communicate the why behind the scheduled times.  Tie in the school vision and goals, and make sure that your schedule truly addresses the issues you faced prior to creating it.</p>
<p>You might also consider creating a <a href="https://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=87809">Google Form</a> asking for anonymous feedback.  Staff members are more apt to be brutally honest if they know there is no way of you knowing who provided the feedback.</p>
<p>5.  Remember &#8211; IT&#8217;S ALL ABOUT THE STUDENTS!</p>
<p>It is important that when working on any building or staff schedule you keep students first.  The goal is to make the most out of every resource you can so that your school can work effectively to enhance student achievement.  Continue to monitor the schedule and if it&#8217;s not working be willing to admit defeat, make changes, or even scrap portions and start over.</p>

<p>Got a Droid?</p>
<p>Got a Mac?</p>
<p>A PC?</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter!</p>
<p>Whatever you have, the <em>free, </em>multi-platform student response system, <a href="http://socrative.com">Socrative.com </a>will use any of these. Did you spend $3000 on Activotes or other student &#8220;clicker&#8221; systems? Well, you could have simply used those laptop carts, those iPads, a desktop computer, or asked your students to <a href="http://edreach.us/2011/05/22/the-future-of-ed-tech-is-%E2%80%9Cbring-your-own-device%E2%80%9D-byod/" target="_blank">bring their own device</a> and fired up Socrative.</p>
<p>For the past few years, I&#8217;ve simply used laptops or desktops with a combination of Google Forms or <a href="http://Polleverywhere.com" target="_blank">Polleverywhere.com</a>. However, there are positives and negatives to these free options. For Google Forms, having students use multiple devices never seemed streamlined. Sure you could fill out a Google Form on an iPod Touch to use as a quick response, but if you want to streamline the process, you might have to create a shortlink from TinyURL.com. Google Forms is still a very broad tool- not optimized specifically for the classroom. As for Polleverywhere, a teacher is limited in the number of responses they can get (40 for classroom size), so I&#8217;ve always run into the problem on the free account of getting too many responses. As a middle school teacher, sometimes I wanted to poll all of my students from the entire day, and I&#8217;d have to create multiple polls on the same questions. Again, although Polleverywhere did add educator accounts, I don&#8217;t feel the tool is optimized for educators.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6148" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Screen shot 2011-08-17 at 9.16.10 AM" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-17-at-9.16.10-AM.png" alt="" width="232" height="136" /></p>
<h3>Optimization</h3>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s Socrative&#8217;s turn. With the recent news of Kindle being <a href="https://read.amazon.com/" target="_blank">available to read on any device,</a> as well as <a href="http://Kno.com" target="_blank">Kno.com</a>, with textbooks being available to read on Facebook, the iPad, or the web in multiple formats, Socrative follows the recent trend of democratizing the web for all users and platforms.</p>
<p>So how does it work? How do you use Socrative in your classroom? Well, for starters you can <a href="http://www.socrative.com/get-started.php" target="_blank">sign up</a>. Socrative is in private beta, but they&#8217;ll open the doors pretty quickly. But for our purposes now, let&#8217;s try it out right here.</p>
<p>First thing you have to remember- there&#8217;s a lecturer&#8217;s console and a student&#8217;s console. The lecturer opens up a room, which is used for students to &#8220;log in,&#8221; very much like <a href="http://Edmodo.com " target="_blank">Edmodo.com </a>uses group codes for students to sign up.  I love that kind of ease of use. Once the lecturer &#8220;chooses an activity&#8221; the student portal will prompt for names and start asking questions. On the lecturer&#8217;s side, they can get live polling data, as the students begin to answer questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-17-at-9.19.05-AM1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6150" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Screen shot 2011-08-17 at 9.19.05 AM" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-17-at-9.19.05-AM1.png" alt="" width="501" height="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another thing you should remember: you can take the time to create an entire quiz <em>inside</em> Socrative, or you can simply ask your students one multiple-choice or true/false question, perhaps to start a lesson and Socrative will allow them to choose A,B,C,D,or E &#8211; no real setup involved.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Socrative has multiple ways to elicit feedback from your students:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Multiple Choice:</strong> What you&#8217;d expect.</li>
<li><strong>True/False:</strong> What you&#8217;d expect.</li>
<li><strong>Short Answer: </strong>Fill in the blank</li>
<li><strong>Quick Quiz:</strong> Use your hand-crafted quizzes.</li>
<li><strong>Exit Ticket:</strong> End of class summaries that ask for some basic understanding of concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Space Race: </strong>Pit two or more teams against each other using one of your hand-crafted quizzes!</li>
</ol>
<div>For me- I&#8217;m a huge fan of formative assessment, and to use the Exit Ticket as a means of &#8220;dip-sticking&#8221; with your students is a great way to constantly check for understanding. Let&#8217;s try a demonstration:</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Demo 1</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">When initiating a quiz, you open a &#8220;room&#8221; inside Socrative. For my example, I created a room titled: <strong>EdReach1</strong>. So, as a student, if you go to <a href="http://m.socrative.com" target="_blank">m.socrative.com </a>on <em>any</em> device, it will prompt you for your room number. Type in: <strong>EdReach1</strong>. Answer the question:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>What is one of your favorite educators to follow on Twitter, Google Plus, or Facebook? </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">[I will keep this demo live for 1 day- however- I may have to close this room after 24 hours]</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Demo 2</h3>
<p>If my room is closed- simply go to <a href="http://socrative.com" target="_blank">Socrative.com </a>and click on &#8220;Start Hands-On Demo.&#8221; Here you&#8217;ll find a sandbox of what the teacher&#8217;s and student&#8217;s console both look like. The hands-on demo takes a little trial and error, but once you get it, you understand how easy it is to hand out quizzes, ask for quick responses, get immediate feedback from students- with no super-long links, easy log in, and ease of use. Always just tell students to go to <a href="http://m.socrative.com/" target="_blank">m.socrative.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Why Socrative?</h3>
<p>I had a chance to talk with Amit Maimon, CEO and Co-Founder of Socrative. Knowing how difficult it is to build an educational start-up business, I asked him what his motivation was for doing so. His response was insightful:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was a teacher&#8217;s assistant at MIT, and as I was teaching class I noticed 3 problems. Students were not engaged, were playing on their iPhone and I &#8211; as a teacher, did not have data telling me if they understood the material or not. On a grand scheme, my passion for education came from being raised in Israel and seeing the difference that education makes and the results of not being educated which can be seen on both sides of the conflict.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hear his dilemma from teachers of all levels. How do we engage a growing student body that is bored, distracted, and otherwise yearning for more interaction in their classrooms? Frontline did a great piece last year <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/view/" target="_blank">addressing this issue.</a> Colleges have it especially difficult because many professors don&#8217;t teach- they talk- and for students who are increasingly needing interaction, university professors have to start upping their game.</p>
<p><a href="http://Socrative.com" target="_blank">Socrative </a>is a great way to &#8220;up your game&#8221; in the classroom or lecture hall. So try it out! <a href="http://www.socrative.com/get-started.php" target="_blank">Sign up</a>, and let&#8217;s hear what you have to say.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://edreach.us/2011/08/14/are-we-screwing-up-the-ipad/broken-ipad/" rel="attachment wp-att-6113"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6113" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Broken-Ipad-224x300.jpg" alt="Oops, a Broken IPad" width="224" height="300" /></a>Over the next few weeks, school is back in session. Fresh paint. Waxed floors. And for some, a new cadre of iPads. Ah, the fresh iPad smell. It is not new technology. The iPad is about a year and a half old. Already we are deep into the second iteration of this device, and on the precipice of the third. But if what has transpired since the launch of the iPad, we, as educators, administrators and tech might be screwing up the iPad.</p>
<p>Before you get all bent out of shape, allow me to explain my thoughts.</p>
<p>First, before the iPad (B.i.) students, by and large, were forced to be tethered to a desk. Laptops were portable, but still fragile. And the software placed on these machines were what the IT coordinator could support or manage. Websites were seen on a screen and manipulated with a keyboard and mouse. The modern keyboard had been in its basic form since the invention of the typewriter. The mouse had been in its form since 1963. And in the B.i. Era, schools installed over bearing filters and placed, at times, severe restrictions on how a student could use a computer. There was little flexibility for a student to define their digital learning space.</p>
<p>Now, after the iPad (A.i.) the landscape has once again changed. Touch replaces kludgy keyboards and mice. What we thought was portable is now really portable (<a href="http://oldcomputers.net/osborne.html" target="_blank">remember when Osborne created a &#8220;portable&#8221; computer?</a>). Students are free to move around outside the cinderblock walls in the A.i. Era. A plethora of apps are now at our disposal that require almost no central management at all. And these apps are as diverse as our students. Students are able to redefine their digital learning space and meet their diverse learning needs quite easily.</p>
<p>The iPad is a device that allows for freedom that few teachers and administrators seems quite ready to embrace.</p>
<p>For all this potential freedom, there has been a push to &#8220;lockdown&#8221; and decide for students how best they should use this device. The &#8220;digital natives&#8221; (if it makes you comfortable to use this term) are being told by &#8220;digital immigrants&#8221; (again, if it makes you comfortable . . .) how to use a truly new and unique device.</p>
<p>Teachers are trying to codify and define a proper use for this unique device. Techs are trying to control and manage this device. Unfortunately, the control and codification we are doing is with 20th Century ideas about education that people who espouse 21st Century ideas about education say were really 19th Century ideas about education (not that I have a problem with Montessori ideas)! I am baffled by excuses about teachers who use being &#8220;digital immigrants&#8221; like it is some sort of crutch to make it OK not to open your eyes to the restrictions being placed on the iPad and like devices.</p>
<p>What we are trying to do with iPad codification for teachers is tantamount to trying to apply the Dewey Decimal System to the Internet for librarians. Regular people use the Internet without much thought about the classification of the website, nor is there thought about whether the website fits a certain intellectual criteria.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to the ideas behind Universal Design for Learning, you might begin to understand that in the A.i. Era we now have a tool that offers multiple paths to demonstrating knowledge and learning. Instead, we, the &#8220;digital immigrants&#8221; are trying to tell the natives how to do it &#8220;right.&#8221; Thirty years ago there was this thought that computers needed to serve pedagogy. But today, we are still trying to fit this wonderful device into that idea of serving pedagogy in lieu of transforming pedagogy. People are categorizing apps into Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy and happy to do so, I <del>think</del> know, because of the comfort it provides some teachers.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? I&#8217;ve been in education for 12 years. Those teachers you had to put technology into comfortable terms are retiring. In the A.i. Era, it is time to strip away the comfort and metamorphose the pedagogy. Seymour Papert wrote and talked about using a computer to transform pedagogy 30 years ago . . . when I was 5!</p>
<p>My ideas specifically for the iPad, in situations where possible, students need 24/7 access. If you really want to codify apps, do so with three easy categories (<a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Software_components">taken from the OLPC XO wiki</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools for Exploring</li>
<li>Tools for Expressing</li>
<li>Tools for Communication</li>
</ul>
<p>Let the students define where their use falls on Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy. Students need administrative controls. Students need the freedom to complete assignments and demonstrate knowledge in ways that give them intrinsic motivation to do so.</p>
<p>No one ever rebelled, or felt unable to express ones self, against too much freedom.</p>

Specifically, he stated that he used the game <em>World of Warcraft </em>and his fabricated addition to it to deflect questions about his whereabouts while planning his attack. He also claimed the game <em>Call of Duty 2: Modern Warfare </em>was his main training program. In the wake of the killings overseas, Norway has pulled all <em>Call of Duty</em> (<em>CoD</em>) and <em>World of Warcraft (WoW)</em> titles from the shelves. Ironically, they have not pulled the new release from EA Games<em>, Battlefield,</em> which is a spot on copy of the <em>CoD</em> series in that it is a violent, war themed, online game.  Obviously this argument has forced media to revisit the issue of what whether life inspires art or if art inspires life. In the past, music, television, movies and video games have holstered the blame for the much of the violence in our culture. Case in point, the release of the movie <em>30 Minutes or Less</em> is <a href="http://social.entertainment.msn.com/movies/blogs/the-hitlist-blogpost.aspx?post=ed8d8d41-a322-4bf1-b21a-a77838d16fe9&amp;GT1=28101">rumored to be protested</a> by a family whose son was killed in a similar bombing attack. In this case, the movie may or may not be mimicking an actual event, but the idea of strapping a bomb to an innocent person is not new to either Hollywood or real life. As for where it started, who knows? Who is responsible for passing these ideas along? Where does media in general fit into this? These are the questions that are looping in my head, and as I analyze my answers and the answers of others, I find myself wavering between different political and moral beliefs.</p>
<p>Who is responsible for violence? Are video games too violent? Do they encourage our children to act out? Do they allow some children with anger issues to appropriately exercise those thoughts and emotions? Should we censor all games because a select few act irrationally? Did Hitler play video games (sarcasm alert)? These questions demand answers. Answers we don’t have. Answers we may never have. Answers to questions that some say don’t even deserve answers. In light of these, here are two most popular opposing viewpoints.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8220;Guns don’t kill people…video games do.&#8221;</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find myself, a person from a Democratic, suburban environment with an extended family from  rural, Republican America, torn on gun laws. Do people have the right to legally carry arms? Legally, yes. Do I have a gun? No. Am I opposed to people carrying firearms? Not necessarily, but depending on the person, I do have reservations. Do we need to allow people to have weapons that are excessive for their environments (see: large weaponry that has no place outside of police units: semi-automatic rifles, large guns, etc)…no. If I could ask only responsible people to carry only responsible arms and only use them with common sense, well that would be my answer, but that would be a bit too utopian. As a lover of video games, I find myself always rushing to their defense as I have in the past for music, movies and pop culture in general. I believe that the responsibility for a person’s actions lies solely with that person. However, am I blindly rushing to the defense of some of these violent video games? Do video games need to be<em> this</em> violent?</p>
<p>Though I find myself only partially supporting gun laws, there is a large sect of extremists that blindly support and promote gun freedom. These people believe in allowing all Americans to possess firearms without much reserve. I believe the trouble lies with these organizations mainly in their inability to be sensitive to other sides of the issue. For example, the National Rifle Association’s (NRA) propensity to hold gun shows and conferences in towns only weeks after violent and deadly school shootings is extremely ridiculous (Google “Charlton Heston, NRA &amp; Columbine, Co, 1999” to find a wide variety of conflicting information about this segment from Michael Moore’s <em>Bowling for Columbine</em> film).</p>
<p>But what does this say about my view of video games? If I believe that there is an extremist group of gun supporters that blindly run to the defense of firearms using the Second Amendment (right to bear arms) as a cover, am I also at fault for blindly running to the defense of video games using the First Amendment (freedom of speech) as a cover? Have I become a video game extremist? Has my moral compass, something which I usually pride myself on, gone way off course by thinking Norway is crazy for banning these games and the media is ridiculous for reporting the claims of a madman and his obsessions?</p>
<h3><strong>&#8220;Guns don’t kill people&#8230;and neither do video games.&#8221;</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As educators we have tough decisions to make. Many of my students play extremely violent video games; video games that I cannot pretend to find an academic avenue to exploit. In fact, most of my students are embedded in a culture where violence is common place in either home life or media. Our current media and culture do nothing to limit this violence, from overtly negative news casts to training programs from our own military. That’s right: the Norwegian gunman didn’t even need to invest in the <em>CoD</em> series. He could have instead opted for the online training game from the US Military called <a href="http://www.americasarmy.com/"><em>America’s Army</em></a>. This training program is not only available to our youth, it is completely free!</p>
<p>So if multiple versions of the same type of violent shooter game are out there (<em>CoD, Battlefield, America’s Army</em>) what good is Norway doing by limiting the sale of <em>CoD </em>and <em>WoW</em> games? Isn’t this just making a wide-spread, blanket rule for a slim exception?  I find it interesting that one  wouldn’t take stock tips from Anders Behring Breivik, but that people have no problem making legislation based on his unprofessional claims regarding video games. Damn the common knowledge that millions of people play these games and  a miniscule amount of people react in the way he did. Damn the fact that massacres like this happened for centuries before video games existed. Damn the fact that Breivik is a disturbed man and should be treated that way. <em>He</em> should pay the cost for his actions, not the sources that he claims ‘inspired’ him. My gut says that video games, movies and music did not create violence, although at times they may endorse or exploit violence it. They are not to blame for the people that carry out these senseless acts. However, maybe this is just me blindly defending my stance as an extremist in the video game culture…</p>

We talked about how poorly teacher colleges prepare new teachers with technology- that EdReach could help new teachers starting new jobs that have little technology support. We talked about EdReach being a place where teachers could drop by every day, and find some new tool, strategy, or relevant news item. Getting that content to those teachers is a challenge. Many of them don&#8217;t use RSS readers.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;d like to believe that every teacher used an RSS feed reader- it&#8217;s just not true. Trying to get your fellow teachers to use Google Reader is sometimes not a possibility. In fact, I hardly use <em>my</em> RSS Reader, unless it&#8217;s through an iPad app. I just find Google Reader dry, and often with too much content.  So- what is the everyday equivalent to that? How does a web publisher get their content to the everyday English teacher, so that we can support them in their daily practice? Should we print EdReach out and mail it to them? Well- that&#8217;s been discussed, but we&#8217;d like to save some trees. The next best avenue is: email.</p>
<p>Over the past week, EdReach has created myriad ways for the everyday teacher to subscribe to our content. Let&#8217;s run down those ways for you right now. Then, why not pass this post on to another teacher who might benefit?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-5995" href="http://edreach.us/2011/08/08/teaching-online-important-concepts/facilitating-online/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5995" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/facilitating.online-300x133.jpg" alt="Facilitating Online Courses: Practical Suggestions" width="300" height="133" /></a>Facilitating an online course is a lot different than teaching a traditional face-to-face course. Success in a traditional classroom does not necessarily translate into success as an online facilitator. There are some fundamental differences between online and traditional courses that explain why a different skill set is required for online instructors:</p>
<ol>
<li>In a traditional course, the majority of instruction is given verbally, in an online course the majority of instruction is written.</li>
<li>In a traditional course, the majority of instruction is given in real-time, in an online course the majority of instruction is on-demand.</li>
<li>In a traditional course, tone and voice are easily communicated, in an online course, tone and voice must be carefully considered and communicated in writing.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most critical skill for the facilitator of an online course is the ability to communicate effectively in writing. A skilled facilitator will be able to communicate the same nuances of spoken communication in writing. Doing so is not easy and takes work. Here are a few tips:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Depth: are your comments substantial and “meaty?” Do they add to the conversation rather than just affirming?</li>
<li>Personality: are you communicating your personality in your posts? Are they dry or do they have a flavor that is entertaining to read. If you didn’t sign your name to a post, would someone know that you wrote it?</li>
<li>Inclusive: are you providing the necessary background information in your posts? Can everyone follow what you are saying? Are you assuming to much? It is also important to make sure that your written communication does not alienate a group based on race, gender, religion, etc.</li>
<li>Humor: “If you don&#8217;t allow humor in your classroom, you will become the subject of humor in your classroom.” Humor is both essential and dangerous. Allow and encourage humor, but recognize that jokes are difficult to convey in written form and can be easily misinterpreted, becoming offensive in the process.</li>
<li>Formal/Neutral: when communicating instructions or expectations, the number 1 goal is clarity. Avoid distractions such as humor, irony, sarcasm, etc as they can be easily misinterpreted. Stick to the facts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tips above were gleaned from an excellent online course titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.plsweb.com/Academic-Programs/Academic-Programs-Finder/Course-Description/(c)/FOLCOL" target="_blank">Online Facilitation</a>&#8221; that I took this summer. The course was created and taught by <a href="http://www.plsweb.com/">Performance Learning Systems</a>. It was a very practical course that helped identify potential challenges facilitating an online course. I would highly recommend this course for anyone moving from a traditional classroom to an online classroom.</p>

EdGamer 20 is short and sweet, but it doesn’t lack any punch! In fact, in honor of our 20th show, we give you a gift.  In this episode we pass along to the listener a list of places we routinely check and monitor to find all the great sites, tools and gadgets we bring to you each week!  We have brought you into the sporadic, sarcastic, app-addicted and often downright scary brain behind EdGamer…good luck and enjoy! 
Additional note-  Gerry needs to understand that there is a difference between Blue’s News and Blue’ Clues.  It is Steve and Joe.  We got Joe correct, but using the word Steven threw me off.  Steven didn’t sound right.  It’s just Steve.

Google is the creator of Chrome and they make it very easy to integrate tools within their browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extensions</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>-<br />
This is my favorite password collector.  I have one master password and it allows to me to store and create secure passwords.  <a href="http://blog.lastpass.com/2010/07/lastpass-gets-green-light-from-security.html">You don’t believe it is secure?</a> Just ask Steve Gibson (<a href="http://www.grc.com/intro.htm">GRC</a>) who is considered one of the top security gurus in the world.  This program is best within the browser.  I have used it on an Android phone and and iPad and it doesn’t run smoothly.</p>
<p>Chrome Web Store link for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd?hl=en-US&amp;hc=search&amp;hcp=main">LastPass</a></p>
<p>Google Mail Checker-<br />
This is a simple extension that indicates if you have any unread messages.  Sometime it is not quick in updating its status, but overall it does its job.  When you click on the icon it takes you to your inbox.</p>
<p>Chrome Web Store link for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mihcahmgecmbnbcchbopgniflfhgnkff?hl=en-US&amp;hc=search&amp;hcp=main">Google Mail Checker</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.delicious.com/">Delicious</a>-<br />
I stopped using this social bookmarking tool and have recently returned.  There are no other bookmarking sites, in my opinion, that do what I want them to do.  Delicious is not perfect, it is just the best tool for my job.  How do I use delicious?  I use Delicious to help teachers I train and it helps my students find the information they need.  (I also have a lot of game links too!)  This extension allows you to bookmark any current page, add a title, add notes,  and add tags.  Bookmarking has become a process and I have learned to streamline this process.  I have created a “New” folder on my bookmarks bar and every few days I will add those bookmarks into Delicious.  After they are added, I then place them into a folder which syncs to all my browsers by using the tool below.</p>
<p>Chrome Web Store link for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lnejbeiilmbliffhdepeobjemekgdnok?hl=en-US&amp;hc=search&amp;hcp=main">Delicious</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.delicious.com/mrgilbertpjhs">My Delicious Links</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.xmarks.com/">Xmarks</a>-<br />
I am torn by this selection.  I used the original Foxmarks, which then turned into Xmarks. (That might have been the time when adding ”X” to words was cool)  The purpose of this program is to be able to sync your favorites with other browsers you use.  You can even sync across different browsers.  This can be very handy in a work situation where you might have limitations on what programs can be installed.  This allowed me to have the bookmarks I have at home sync with those at work.  (Be careful on what you bookmark)<br />
Eventually I was having trouble syncing my bookmarks with Xmarks.  I don’t know what the problem was, but it got very annoying.  It was at this time when I started using Chrome almost exclusively and realized that I could sync my browser information using my Google account.  This was great and it did a wonderful and quick job of updating my favorites until this past spring.  I noticed that my bookmarks had not synced for 15 days.  I researched the problem and it could not be solved.  So now I am back to Xmarks and it seems to working well.  If anyone has any new information about this type of sync, please let me know.</p>
<p>Chrome Web Store link for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ajpgkpeckebdhofmmjfgcjjiiejpodla?hl=en-US&amp;hc=search&amp;hcp=main">Xmarks</a></p>
<p>Screen Capture (by Google)-<br />
This is my newest and favorite extension.  I found this while trying to find pictures for a <a href="http://prezi.com/">Prezi</a>, another great tool.  This screen capture tool allows me to capture a page, visible content, whole page, and a region.  I can save the image as a PNG or JPEG.  You can edit the image by highlighting, adding text, and lines.  This extension has become very popular and it is easy to see why.</p>
<p>Chrome Web Store link for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cpngackimfmofbokmjmljamhdncknpmg?hl=en-US&amp;hc=search&amp;hcp=main">Screen Capture</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apps</span></p>
<p>I was going to include all the apps I use within Chrome but time, space, and making this a quick read will not allow it.  The list below is just a quick reference of the apps I do use.  All of them except TweetDeck are simple links. Please let me know if you have any questions about their functionality.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>Chrome Web Store Links</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hphjpfmagbhbdfhdndglcccmhdjhjjce?hl=en-US&amp;hc=search&amp;hcp=main">Remember the Milk</a>- A great to-do list.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hbdpomandigafcibbmofojjchbcdagbl?hl=en-US&amp;hc=search&amp;hcp=main">Tweet Deck</a>- A great way to see all your tweets and Facebook stream.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ejjicmeblgpmajnghnpcppodonldlgfn?hl=en-US&amp;hc=search&amp;hcp=main">Google Calendar</a>- A simple link to your Google Calendar.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apdfllckaahabafndbhieahigkjlhalf?hl=en-US&amp;hc=search&amp;hcp=main">Google Docs</a>- A simple link to your Google Docs.</p>

<p>To start the year you might think about having your students create a <a href="http://storybird.com/">StoryBird</a> highlighting their summer vacation, or you might create one to help explain some of your classroom procedures.</p>
<p><a href="http://storybird.com/">StoryBird</a> has amped up its efforts to offer its tools for educators by including the ability to set up classroom accounts for students.  The registration is easy and does not require students to have email addresses.  Check out the teacher page <a href="http://storybird.com/teachers/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once the class is created you can give logins to students and begin mixing up some great stories.  The students can share and favorite their peers&#8217; stories.</p>
<p>So if you have never checked out <a href="http://storybird.com/">StoryBird</a> you should take some time to do so; and if you have used it in the past, but have gotten away from it, it&#8217;s time to revisit an ol&#8217; favorite.</p>

<p><em> </em>Having students create videos is a great way to enhance student learning.  Creating a video allows a student to think strategically about a topic and deepens analytical skills.  Yet, there is a problem.  Just creating a video mashup, utilizing fancy tools like <a href="http://animoto.com/">Animoto</a>, isn’t enough.  It’s not about the video, it’s about the process of creation.  The process is where the learning occurs.</p>
<div id="attachment_1935" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://blog.currix.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Lost.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1935 " style="margin-top: 1px;margin-bottom: 1px;margin-left: 2px;margin-right: 2px" src="http://blog.currix.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Lost-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image Courtesy of ABC Studios / Bad Robot</p></div>
<p>Let me explain.  Over the last 100 years, IQ scores have steadily increased.  <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/author/jonah_lehrer/">Wired columnist, Jonah Lehrer</a> just wrote about the reasoning for “<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/flynneffect.shtml">the Flynn effect</a>” in his column.  He explains that one of the increasingly cited factors for this increase is actually the complexity of entertainment, which actually might enhance abstract problem solving skills.  <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/are-smart-people-getting-smarter/">“This suggests that, because people are now forced to make sense of <em>Lost</em> or the Harry Potter series or World of Warcraft, they’re also better able to handle hard logic puzzles.”</a></p>
<p>The process of thinking strategically about story forces students to pare down information to its most important facts and build the sequencing of information into a cohesive whole.  The process of creating a video is strategic problem solving. It should force students to think about the information at a <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/back-to-basics-the-big-picture.html">50,000 foot level</a>, then begin to pull out strategic pieces of information, and act upon that information.  Isn’t that exactly how you build a business, solve a societal problem, or develop new inventions?</p>
<p>Yet for many students, looking at a mishmash of information is always overwhelming.  Even for me, as a <a href="http://www.currix.com/about.html">documentary filmmaker and web startup founder,</a> I can still feel that way when approaching a complex topic.  Here’s how I teach my students to process:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Create a logline.</strong> A logline is one sentence about your story.  (This is like the theme of a paper and the answer to “Why does this matter?”).</p>
<p>2) Use post-its or index cards to <strong>extract important information</strong>.  Don’t write out sentences,  only keywords.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Think through the framework. </strong>The framework to a story works the same way as a framework to a business plan or legal argument.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the stage.  Create the environment.  Give the establishing shot. Where are we?</li>
<li>Introduce the characters.  Who are they?</li>
<li>Give your audience the hook.  Why should they care?  How does this matter to them?</li>
<li>Build to the climax.  What is at stake?</li>
<li>The “Denouement” &#8211; also called the wrap up.  This word actually means untying the knot.  Don&#8217;t just throw out the ending&#8230;untie it.</li>
</ol>
<p>4) <strong>Build the framework. </strong>Use the post-its to <strong>sequence the information </strong>from the framework, then and only then allow students to begin editing.</p>
<p>There are some great free online tools for editing like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/editor">YouTube Video Editor</a>, <a href="http://www.pixorial.com/">Pixorial</a>, <a href="http://www.creaza.com/">Creaza</a>,  and you can even download free trials of fun software like <a href="http://www.openplanetsoftware.com/smoovie/">Smoovie</a> (awesome and easy for stop-motion) and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/downloads/">Adobe Premiere</a>.</p>
<p>One of the things that can be difficult in creating videos is having the video content to utilize in the classroom.  <a href="http://www.currix.com">Currix</a> is an educational marketplace that features downloadable video content and amazing graphics that you can utilize in creating your videos for the classroom.  Find videos and music from around the world you can utilize for your class in creating your video lessons.</p>
<p>Also, check out a fantastic book about building a story by Hollywood screenwriter, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009">Blake Snyder called “Save the Cat.” </a> If you are interested in having your students create longer videos in the classroom, it will give you a fantastic perspective on story and help you show your students how to create problems and solve them in their own stories.</p>
<p>What are you doing in your classroom with video?  Is it making your students smarter?</p>

It helped me feel like I was part of the &#8220;grown up&#8221; world, asking for a section of the newspaper to read. But, it also taught me about <a href="http://www.familycircus.com/" target="_blank">family</a>, <a href="http://www.arcamax.com/thefunnies/beetlebailey/" target="_blank">war</a>, <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/marmaduke/?ref=comics" target="_blank">animals</a>, and a whole lot more&#8230; I remember doodling the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=7-up+spot&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RT85TqDwBrKmsQKt-YQU&amp;ved=0CDcQsAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=738" target="_blank">7-UP Spot</a> for hours &#8211; turning him into a swashbuckling pirate, swinging between the masts of ships, all to meet his downfall when the Chinese invented gunpowder&#8230; One of my friends and I would take long rolls of paper about 7&#8243; high and create evolving stories and worlds that you could simply roll up and take with you. All you needed was a pencil and you could be telling a story, solving math problems in inventive ways, re-creating history&#8230;</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-5716" href="http://edreach.us/2011/08/03/toondoo-com-a-comic-can-bring-topics-to-life/img-7up-breakout-box-4-spot_144621699059/"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-5716" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/img-7up-breakout-box-4-spot_144621699059-132x150.png" alt="" width="132" height="150" /></a>I think I chose &#8220;Cool Spot&#8221; well&#8230; because he was a thick circle with noodle arms and big shoes and amazingly easy to draw. Heck, I might have even started with him because you can trace a quarter and get a circle&#8230; However, not all kids (or adults) feel they can draw or even doodle well. So, here is where <a href="http://toondoo.com" target="_blank">ToonDoo.com</a> steps in for those of us who can only draw circles. <a href="http://toondoo.com" target="_blank">ToonDoo</a> is a great online resource for everyone and anyone to be able to create cartoons.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://toondoo.com" target="_blank">ToonDoo</a>, students can use comics and cartoon characters to demonstrate concepts, display language skills, present ideas, dreams, and even fears all without worrying whether or not they can draw. <a href="http://toondoo.com" target="_blank">ToonDoo</a> has a simply interface and a very robust set of over 8000 built-in AND CUSTOMIZABLE props for students to choose from to create their comics. <a href="http://toondoo.com" target="_blank">ToonDoo</a> even has multi-language support for text. In addition, there are the 4-R&#8217;s of <a href="http://toondoo.com" target="_blank">ToonDoo</a> for more creativity:</p>
<ul>
<li>ImagineR &#8211; Allows for images to be uploaded and then modified.</li>
<li>DoodleR &#8211; An artist palette that let&#8217;s a student draw on top of his or her toons.</li>
<li>TraitR &#8211; Allows students to create characters from scratch and turn them into avatars.</li>
<li>SocialR &#8211; A social wrapper that allows for others to comment, follow, and favorite others work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features like the ability to create single to multiple panel (horizontal or vertical) comic strips, change postures for the built-in props, and even the ability to create complete books from student&#8217;s work that can then be printed, shared, or embedded. What a fun way to have students share concept and skill knowledge with their parents. Think of some of the possibilities for <a href="http://toondoo.com" target="_blank">ToonDoo</a>:</p>
<p>Math and Science &#8211; Presenting equations, formulas, or concepts&#8230; (can you imagine a periodic table made from <a href="http://toondoo.com" target="_blank">ToonDoo</a> comics?)</p>
<p>ESL / World Language / English &#8211; Practicing language skills and conversations, words and expressions, skills and understanding for readings, plays, and more&#8230;</p>
<p>Social Studies &#8211; Past and Current events, moments in history, political ideas&#8230;</p>
<p>Art &#8211; The possibilities are endless&#8230;</p>
<p>More&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.toondoo.com/" target="_blank">ToonDoo</a> is a free and public site so there may be some concern about content. To address this, there is both a safe search component to the site, and the option for educators to set up a private and secure ToonDooSpaces account. Note: there is a free 15 day trial for <a href="http://www.toondoospaces.com/" target="_blank">ToonDooSpaces</a> as it is a low-cost fee service. Here is a <a href="http://www.toondoospaces.com/schoolsbrochure.pdf" target="_blank">brochure</a> about ToonDooSpaces for more information.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/POpplet.com_1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5702" title="POpplet.com" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/POpplet.com_1.png" alt="" width="285" height="209" /></a>I&#8217;m always on the lookout for new ways to create, design, and visualize. The presentation tool <a href="http://prezi.com">Prezi.com </a>has always been a unique way to create whiz-bang visuals for professional development conferences or workshops, and has a nice way of drawing the viewers in.<a href="http://Voicethread.com"> Voicethread.com</a> is also one of those unique tools that educators have latched on to for lots of different authentic purposes. I&#8217;ve been ready for something new.</p>
<p>And now comes <a href="http://Popplet.com" target="_blank">Popplet.com</a>. Popplet is like a cross between Prezi, <a href="http://Glogster.com" target="_blank">Glogster</a>, and Kidspiration (or <a href="http://mywebspirtation.com" target="_blank">mywebspirtation.com</a>). At first when I tried Popplet, my first inkling was to create a poster in the vein of Glogster- thinking how teachers and students might be using this tool. When you open the Popplet sandbox, your task is to create a series of popples. You can simple type in the popple, change the color, you can draw using a pen tool, or you can add an image from Flickr, your own image, or a YouTube video.</p>
<p><a href="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Popplet-buttons.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5699 alignnone" title="Popplet buttons" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Popplet-buttons.png" alt="" width="429" height="310" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unlike Prezi, which I consider to be somewhat intimidating for some people to use, Popplet is very intuitive and pretty simple. You can connect your popples to each other much like you connect mind-map bubbles to each other. On a recent project I was working on, I was asked to create a storyboard for an Android app that I was creating. At first, I was told to use Webspiration, but it occurred to me that Popplet would be a great visualization tool for my storyboard. You can see below how the popples are connected, include multiple types of objects, various colors, and are easy to read (zoom in).</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><object width="460" height="460"><param name="movie" value="http://popplet.com/app/Popplet_Alpha.swf?page_id=48860&amp;em=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="460" height="460" src="http://popplet.com/app/Popplet_Alpha.swf?page_id=48860&amp;em=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="false"></embed></object>&lt;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This was my storyboard for the <a href="http://youtube.com/mathademics" target="_blank">Mathademics</a> app, which is a YouTube channel I created for uploading math lessons. I like that Popplet is not just a one-tool pony. It&#8217;s not just for creating online posters- educators will be able to find multiple uses for a tool like this. This summer I taught a group of youngsters, and we brainstormed how Popplet could be used for digital storytelling. Students said that you could use it for brainstorming the story, then storyboarding it, and finally by using a screen capture software for possibly filming a Popplet in action.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some extras to think about:</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>You can collaborate with other &#8220;Popplers&#8221; in real time.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s easy to share. Here&#8217;s the link to an interesting Popplet on the history of Coke bottles: <a href="http://popplet.com/app/#/358" target="_blank">http://popplet.com/app/#/358</a></li>
<li>Obviously embeddable.</li>
<li>It has a bookmarklet tool that allows you to save/tag images from the web to add to your popplets. Convenient.</li>
<li>There is a Popplet app in the iTunes store: get it <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/popplet-lite/id364738549?mt=8" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, definitely add Popplet into you arsenal of tools to draw from this year. If you have any to share, let us know. [tweetbutton]</p>

<p>Once you receive an invitation, you will be  able to create topics that you would like to curate.  Curating a topic is relatively easy.  First, you will be asked to provide a title, description, keywords, and icon (optional).  Scoop.it will then crawl the web and <em>suggest</em> content to your topic based on the keywords you provided.  You will then be presented with a feed of suggested sources &amp; content, which you then choose either to &#8220;Remove Source&#8221;, &#8220;Discard&#8221;, or &#8220;Scoop.it&#8221;.   You are also able to add additional sources, such as RSS feeds, Twitter users or lists, custom Twitter searches, custom Google searches, Facebook pages, &amp; others by clicking on the Manage Sources button and clicking on the &#8220;Advanced Options&#8221; tab.  Another way to add content to your topic is using the <a href="http://www.scoop.it/bookmarkletInfo" target="_blank">Scoop.it bookmarklet</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a short video about Scoop.it:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnr6QKKcsII" target="_blank">Scoop.it on YouTube</a></p>
<p>Are you interested in the latest news related to accessibility, assistive technology, AAC, &amp; other topics related to the use of technology in special education?  Then you should check out my new scoop.it on &#8220;<a href="http://www.scoop.it/t/specialedtech" target="_blank">Technology in Special Education</a>&#8220;! This is a news feed that I will be regularly curating.</p>

(Did you notice the Qwiki of the Day on the sidebar?) For those of you who have not yet have the pleasure of experiencing Qwiki, it is a fantastic tool that allows you to learn about literally millions of different topics in a matter of moments. According to Wikipedia, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwiki" target="_blank">Qwiki is a platform that creates interactive, on-the-fly, multimedia presentations of information.</a>” Basically, Qwiki lets you quickly learn about almost anything &#8211; people, places and/or things &#8211; in a multimedia format! It truly is <a href="http://edreach.us/2010/12/29/qwiki-an-information-experience/" target="_blank">an information “Experience”</a>.</p>
<p>As if the free <a href="http://www.Qwiki.com">Qwiki.com</a> website wasn’t great enough, they have gotten even better by going mobile! You can now <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=373717412&amp;mt=8">download their app for the iPad</a> via the App Store. After playing around with the app for quite awhile, here are a few of my favorite features of the Qwiki app:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> </strong>it is a combination of images, maps, videos and infographics that are narrated by voice and text to create a short digital story that is relevant to today</li>
<li><strong> </strong>you can explore topics by searching, browsing a map, or simply by what’s popular</li>
<li><strong> </strong>once you have watched one Qwiki, it will make suggestions for other related Qwiki you may enjoy</li>
<li>it goes where ever you and your iPad go!</li>
</ul>
<p>A Qwiki is a great way to introduce new topics, expand on previously mentioned topics, review topics quickly, or just let students tap into their own curiosity to learn. This is a great tool to bring into your classroom, regardless of how tech-savvy you may or may not be. If you can type a topic, Qwiki will work for you!</p>
<p>With rave reviews from ABC News, TechCrunch, and The Washington Post, it is clear that Qwiki is just getting started. Like <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/drezac" target="_blank">Daniel Rezac</a>, I have to wonder, <a href="http://edreach.us/2011/05/31/go-qwiki-yourself-the-next-best-platform-for-storytelling/">is Qwiki the next, best platform for digital storytelling</a>? If you are an iPad user, download the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qwiki/id373717412?mt=8">FREE app</a> (and if you don’t have an iPad, just head over to <a href="http://www.Qwiki.com">Qwiki.com</a>!) and let us know your thoughts on using this awesome tool in the classroom!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5177" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/G+-in-Education.0011-300x100.jpg" alt="G+ in Education" width="300" height="100" />Twitter just became 5 years old and many of us can remember the first time: we heard of twitter&#8230; the first time we experienced powerful collaboration on twitter&#8230; some of us can even remember our first tweet (not me, though I can imagine it was something like: &#8220;I just don&#8217;t understand this&#8230;&#8221; So, for many it feels like a shock when after 5 years, thousands of tweets, hours of growing and grooming our personal learning network we look at Google+ and say, &#8220;I just don&#8217;t understand this&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Struggling to understand how this is going to fit in&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;It just doesn&#8217;t do what Facebook or twitter does&#8230; or doesn&#8217;t do it as WELL&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are some other things that we are struggling with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;I have &#8220;spoken&#8221; with a person for years on twitter&#8230; but I only know them by his or her handle&#8230; &#8211; We are shocked that someone we really know so well: children, ailments, dreams, hopes, personal challenges&#8230; and we don&#8217;t even know his or her name.</li>
<li>&#8220;I can&#8217;t figure out Circles&#8221; &#8211; A new paradigm is frustrating or our attempt to force something new into our preconceived notion of HOW things SHOULD work.</li>
<li>&#8220;I have been on Google+ for an &#8220;x&#8221; now, and I can&#8217;t figure out how to find other&#8217;s with similar interests (or it is too hard to find them&#8230;) &#8211; Yes, an actual person search within Google+ will be very welcome when it is enabled &#8211; ironic, huh?!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are feeling this way, know that you are not alone. Many of us are feeling this way too. That said, I am really enjoying the rich conversations and more personal relationships that I am building with Google+ that in some ways I have been feeling I have lost on Twitter and Facebook. The biggest thing to remember is that we felt this exact same way when we first tweeted or facebooked. Back then, worked through a whole lot of growing pains to develop the robust PLN&#8217;s we now enjoy. But, the first thing we all need to do is feel a bit less lonely when we are on Google+. So, here are a few tips and suggestions to help get you started (or re-started) growing your PLN in Google+</p>
<p>First, build out your personal profile with information about what you teach, your goals, a twitter handle, blog link, and possibly the types of connections you are looking for&#8230; Many&#8230; MANY&#8230; are using this as an initial barometer for whether or not to add someone into a circle. Additionally, as I wrote earlier, we have a LOT of relationships from twitter where we unfortunately don&#8217;t know a person&#8217;s real name or at least his or her last name to make a connection that VanishingPoint is actually Scott Weidig.</p>
<p>Second, there has been an &#8220;Educators on Plus&#8221; google doc floating around. <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AonjNnYJSH0ndDJEWmkxeHZPQkNqTXlhWm9NbVJGWlE&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html" target="_blank">HERE</a> is a link to that doc. Almost all have even listed areas of focus or teaching. Also, go <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDJEWmkxeHZPQkNqTXlhWm9NbVJGWlE6MQ" target="_blank">HERE</a> to add yourself to this growing list.</p>
<p>Third, and the best way I have come across personally, is to post more publicly or to &#8220;extended circles&#8221; which will catch a larger audience. For example, if YOU post to extended circles it goes not only to the individuals in your own personal circles, but also to all of the individuals in their circles as well even though they are not in your circles. In addition, &#8220;public&#8221; posts are searchable on Google itself (even if we currently can&#8217;t search within Plus itself). Many will read or comment on your posts and throw an add to you.</p>
<p>Fourth, to respond to other educator&#8217;s posts. That way, much like twitter, you will be pulled into conversations with educators you may not be following. Click into their profiles link to review for an add.</p>
<p>Fifth, Google+ has two &#8220;features&#8221; that are not easily understandable: &#8220;incoming&#8221; and &#8220;nearby&#8221;. Incoming are the streams of people who have added you into a circle, but are not in one of your circles. This is a way to see who is &#8220;following&#8221; you and the quality of information they are posting before you add them to a circle. Nearby are all of the public posts from people who have geotagged their posts and are physically &#8220;nearby&#8221; you at that time. I can imagine that this stream will be flooded at conferences in the future, but this is also a way to reach out beyond your budding network for possibly some fresh insight. (I ended up making contact with a great person who was able to provide some information on web hosting while I was on vacation a few weeks ago, simply by posting publicly and looking at &#8220;nearby&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sixth, if you have not thought about blogging, think about it. If you are, be sure that is on your profile, and link your posts on Plus. Sharing your journey with others creates a bond and common interest which can help you grow your PLN.</p>
<p>Finally, we encourage you to link up with the members of EdReach.us on Google+. Here is a list of the EdReach folks on Google+ and a direct link to each of our profiles:</p>

He blogs regularly at EdReach.us about mobile learning, media literacy, and educational change.</p>
<p>On a last note, I know many educators who are working hard to attempt to &#8220;re-create&#8221; the educational PLN&#8217;s they already have on Twitter and Facebook. In essence, &#8220;port&#8221; them over to Google+. While there are a num,her of new tools being developed to accomplish this, I would encourage everyone to think hard before doing this. One one hand, I think it is a great an potentially powerful idea, on the other, Google+ has a different variety of tools to offer, different ways to think of relationships, I encourage everyone to take advantage of this opportunity to perhaps re-focus or broaden and maybe even deepen your PLN as opposed to simply re-creating it. We can learn so much from those we yet do not know&#8230; Just my perspective.</p>
<p>If you are on Google+ also and want, leave your information in the comments so the edReachers can connect with you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5624" style="margin: 10px;" title="Twitter _ Search - #eduwin-1" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Twitter-_-Search-eduwin-1.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="200" />I get excited about education a lot!  One thing continues to bother me though and that is the continued lack of a cohesive effort to celebrate success in our schools.  We have so many people embedded in reform that we end up putting out more of a negative message than may be productive.  <a href="http://edreach.us/about/">EdReach.us</a> is focused on combining our voice to give everyone a bigger voice! As our <a href="http://edreach.us/about/">About Us</a> page states &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>We all want one thing- to take education forward. As much as we may argue, we still want what’s best for our future thinkers and creators that are sitting behind little tiny desks and also behind great big board room tables.</p>
<div>Education has never gotten the voice that it’s truly deserved- just check any Online newspaper and look for the education section. Keep looking- because you won’t find it there.</div>
<div>But you will find that section here.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>With this in mind, when I was at <a href="http://www.edubloggercon.com/EduBloggerCon+2011">EduBloggerCon</a> in Philadelphia recently, I submitted a session that was focused on education, media, and the messages we want to be sent.  The question I had was, &#8220;<em><strong>Why isn’t education on the front page of the news?&#8221;. </strong></em></p>
<p>For me, the answer in so many ways comes back to what <a href="http://edreach.us/about/">EdReach.us</a> is all about!  While I have been perseverating over the issue for quite sometime, a <a href="http://blog.teachersfirst.com/thinkteach/2011/07/08/eduwin-a-miraclegrowing-edubloggerconcept/#comment-17294" target="_blank">colleague</a> of ours who was in the session wrote up a nice piece about the conversation and one great idea that came out of it, &#8220;<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a>&#8220;.  I asked <a href="http://blog.teachersfirst.com/thinkteach/2011/07/08/eduwin-a-miraclegrowing-edubloggerconcept/" target="_blank">Candace</a> if we could cross post it and she has agreed.  Thank you <a href="http://blog.teachersfirst.com/thinkteach/2011/07/08/eduwin-a-miraclegrowing-edubloggerconcept/" target="_blank">Candace</a> for this well written piece!  <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a> </strong><em>(more about the author at the end of this post)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">______________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8230; One of the discussion topics (EdubloggerCon) I chose to join this year was entitled <em><strong>Why isn’t education on the front page of the news? </strong>(Let’s talk about strategies to push this important discussion to the forefront in a positive and meaningful way). </em>The gist of the discussion was that yes, we can convince local news to cover a unique event at our school, but that’s the end of it. No one will ever hear positive stories about learning in today’s schools in higher venues. When will positive stories about the bloomin’ good ever gain national notice?  It is much easier (and generates ratings) when the media cover:</p>
<p>a. stories of education failures</p>
<p>b. stats of comparisons to other cultures– limited to the first sentence of the Executive Summary</p>
<p>c. stories of the high cost of education to taxpayers</p>
<p>d. all of the above</p>
<p>Fortunately, this EBC group was pro-active in approach and did not linger in the weeds of  woe-is-us-nobody-likes-teachers. We brainstormed. We generated a very do-able, very positive, and very realistic strategy to make the voices of winning education stories resound beyond the local news: the hashtag <strong>#eduwin</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time you see a change in a student because of something that clicked, write about it in a tweet or a blog post, hashtagged <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Every time you see another teacher do something that works, share it, hashtagged <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Every time you see a tweet from another educator  about the way students are LEARNING, retweet it or share it on Facebook, hashtagged <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a></strong>.</li>
<li>When you’re having a bad day, set up a Twitter search or do one on Google (when they get Real Time working again), looking for items hashtagged <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a></strong>.</li>
<li>When you hear people griping about the state of education today, share a story you saw hashtagged <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a></strong>.</li>
<li>When your class does projects, shoot some video and upload the clips of kids talking about what they did to YouTube, hashtagged <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a> </strong>(cute kids or kittens can’t hurt…)</li>
<li>When a parent volunteer wants to be helpful, ask him/her to take some pictures of the good things going on in your class (maybe from the back or close-ups of hands so there is no concern about identifiable pictures) and share them on Flickr or Facebook, hashtagged <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a></strong>.</li>
<li>When your kids make glogs, Voicethreads, or other online projects that shout powerful evidence of learning, add the hashtag <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a></strong> to the very best examples (and resist the urge to put the hashtag on ones that could be appreciated without context)</li>
<li>When you give awards to your students, us the title EDUWIN on the awards.</li>
<li>When that one non-reader finally recognizes the sight words, clap and say “<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a>!”</li>
<li>Collaborate every day with teacher colleagues on the digital storytelling of E<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an FYI, one of those in the discussion asked whether the tag is <em>Ed-U-Win</em> or <em>eduwin</em>or <em>edUwin</em> or <em>edu-win</em>. It is read as any and all of these, but written simply,<strong> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a></strong>.  For through <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a></strong>, you win, our kids win, we all win, and edu wins.</p>
<p>Now you have to pass it on. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/eduwin" target="_blank">#EduWin</a>. You’re it.</p>

I am also amazed that the story has not really gotten more media attention frankly!  People can really use our help &#8230; educator type of help!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, educators are some of the most giving people in so many ways.  No matter what we are hearing from many states with regard to unions, contracts, and money, we know that we give of ourselves a lot.  How many of us spend our own money on our classrooms and our kids on a regular basis?  Well, let&#8217;s see if we can spread the word to help some children in Minot, North Dakota as well.  Even if you can&#8217;t send money yourself, see if you can help spread the word and get this in front of some of our colleagues.  Let&#8217;s see if we can make a difference!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Help Children in Minot: </strong>Minot, ND was hit with record-breaking flooding and needs your help. So much was lost, including school supplies for the thousands of students living there. Every dollar counts, so please donate what you can to help a child in need.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://kinf.org/minot/">Minot Donation Page</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Can we help them?  I think so &#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5608" title="logo_press" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/logo_press-300x300.png" alt="" width="270" height="270" />I use YouTube to host most of my tutorials. Up until now, I have always used a Google Site, or a Google Presentation to lay out all of those step-by-step instructions. However, I&#8217;ve stumbled across a site that focuses strictly on step-by-step. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://tildee.com">Tildee.com,</a> and they&#8217;ve made it super easy to create a step-by-step process.</p>
<p>Teachers will like this: it&#8217;s got a super simple user-interface, they&#8217;re extremely easy to share to a group or a classroom. Students will like this because this makes it easy to stay on task during a lesson, and it&#8217;s harder for minds to wander when instruction is so well laid out.</p>
<p>Similar to a tool like<a href="http://qwiki.com"> Qwiki.com</a>, Tildee is basically a content aggregator, meaning they&#8217;re using content that&#8217;s already available, and allowing the creator to re-purpose that content- then present it in a more intuitive fashion.  Creating a tutorial here is simple:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you start a new tutorial, you simply need to add some text for your steps, then insert a YouTube video (that you previously recorded). You can also add a Google Map or a screen capture image.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5604" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Tildee step1" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-26-at-9.49.04-AM.png" alt="" width="603" height="323" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Continue going through these steps until you have all of your steps, then, you&#8217;re done! They&#8217;ve made sharing your tutorial super easy. Here&#8217;s a tutorial that I created entitled <strong>Creating a PowerPoint Animation</strong>. This uses tutorial videos that I created over the past couple years, but have now found new life here on Tildee.  The link is here: <a href="http://www.tildee.com/cis0Vb" target="_blank">http://www.tildee.com/cis0Vb</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5605" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Screen shot 2011-07-26 at 9.53.24 AM" src="http://edreach.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-26-at-9.53.24-AM.png" alt="" width="607" height="335" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, a couple questions remain: why would I use this over, say, a Google Site or presentation? What does Tildee offer that I can&#8217;t do, simply by using a web page? The answer to that is function. When you get a link on Tildee, you know what its purpose is, you know that it&#8217;s there to show you something, and it has a familiar user interface.  Just as students know what YouTube&#8217;s purpose is, students will know what to expect as they get used to arriving at <a href="Tildee.com" target="_blank">Tildee.com</a>. I think that can be powerful when giving instruction. It&#8217;s also super easy to set up, and you might save yourself a little time and effort by using Tildee. If you want, you can add the Tildee link to your teacher page, or unit page on your teacher site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From my experience using tutorials, kids will like this because it&#8217;s structured, and you&#8217;ll have a lot less confusion. Give it a try, and let us know what you think.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce that next year my school, <a href="http://www.southfieldchristian.org/" target="_blank">Southfield Christian</a>, is launching a 1:1 iPad initiative in our high school. All students in grades 9-12 will receive an iPad to take home and keep for the entire school year.</p>
<p>We have been planning and preparing for this even for over a year. Our decision to go with the iPad had to do with the cost:feature ratio, ease of use, maintenance track record, and power consumption. We were very excited that the launch of the iPad2 came just before we placed our order.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.southfieldchristian.org/webtech/" target="_blank">Peter Webber</a>, IT Director at Southfield Christian, has done a marvelous job in preparing the infrastructure of the school for the massive increase in wireless devices. As our program launches, we will share some of the resources and documentation we have created to help other schools launch similar programs.</p>
<p>I was happy to see the positive coverage that our program received in this month&#8217;s <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2011/07/13/ipad-training-101.aspx" target="_blank">THE Journal</a>. Our staff training was a great success and got our teaching staff excited about using the iPads in the classroom next year. We purposely scheduled our staff training in the early summer so that the teachers could play around and become more comfortable with their iPads before returning to school in the fall. They teaching staff is also recommending apps to include for student use.</p>
<p>Southfield Christian is also happy to announce that we will be co-hosting an  <a href="http://techtools4teaching.org/?page_id=81" target="_blank">iPad conference</a> on October 20-21 sponsored by the Michigan Association of Computer Users in Learning (<a href="http://macul.org/" target="_blank">MACUL</a>).  The conference features a full day of hands on workshops as well as a full day of sessions related to the iPad in education. Conference registration opens in August.</p>
<p>The iPad is a great tool, but it doesn&#8217;t replace quality teaching staff or sound teaching principles. Our excellent teaching staff is excited to leverage the technology afforded by the ipad to enhance student engagement and achievement in the coming school year.</p>
