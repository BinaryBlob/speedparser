			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jann Wenner, founder of Rolling Stone, <a href="http://adage.com/article/mediaworks/jann-wenner-magazines-tablet-migration-decades/227827/?page=2">doesn&#8217;t think that the iPad will replace traditional print magazines anytime soon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; font: normal normal normal 13px/18px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;"><em><strong style="outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Mr. Wenner:</strong> Not months. Decades, probably. People&#8217;s habits will shift, they&#8217;ll make improvements in the delivery system, the screen will change, it will get lighter, whatever, and new people growing up will find that as a habit. But you&#8217;re talking about a generation at least, maybe two generations, before the shift is decisive.</em></p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; font: normal normal normal 13px/18px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;"><em>Look at the music industry as an example. I think it&#8217;s split about 50-50 between CDs and digital delivery. There is a place where there are extraordinary advantages in the distribution delivery system. Otherwise the products are indistinguishable; there&#8217;s no difference in the physical products as there is here.</em></p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; font: normal normal normal 13px/18px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;"><em>And yet it&#8217;s still a generational shift going on. And we&#8217;re far away from that. We have a much different and more unique product than just the CD.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; font: normal normal normal 13px/18px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">Mr. Wenner started Rolling Stone a few decades ago for $7,500 with volunteer labor, but now from his perspective a publishing mogul he thinks it impossible to start a magazine without millions at your disposal. His rather myopic viewpoint leads him to believe that the same thing couldn&#8217;t happen today as he achieved all those years ago. Huffington Post anyone?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; font: normal normal normal 13px/18px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">He also believes that the printed magazine is much different and unique than a CD. He doesn&#8217;t get that it is just content; the delivery mechanism is meaningless. He, and many others, also don&#8217;t get the potential for tablet delivery to be so much more than printed magazine delivery.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; font: normal normal normal 13px/18px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">A printed magazine is dead content. It can&#8217;t be updated or augmented. It can reference information the hasn&#8217;t been created or doesn&#8217;t exist yet. Tablet delivery is live. A tablet magazine can be corrected (transparently), and it can be updated to reference future information as it arises. Articles can reference older articles. They can be bookmarked, commented on, tagged, and shared.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; font: normal normal normal 13px/18px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">Successful iPad magazines won&#8217;t just display the paper version via a different delivery mechanism. They will deliver all of the relevant information that is available. It isn&#8217;t about moving your existing paper magazine to the iPad; it is about delivering a brand new kind of experience for the platform and the medium. And they won&#8217;t take decades; they are happening now. Mr. Wenner is just so caught up in his existing business model to see that.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; font: normal normal normal 13px/18px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">But someone who isn&#8217;t will see the value. Just as Mr. Wenner successfully did so many years ago.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It looks like come hell or high water, <a href="http://rapidtransit.region.waterloo.on.ca/about-the-project.html">Waterloo Region is going to have a Light Rail Transit system</a>, whether residents want it or not. Pretty much every option presented includes an LRT component. We are told that the majority of attendees at public information sessions were in favour. Whe<a href="http://www.therecord.com/news/article/285948--waterloo-council-poised-to-reject-rail-transit-plan">n politicians note the overwhelming opposition to LRT on doorsteps</a>, those people are merely derided as stupid, misinformed, or misguided. The Region knows better than they do.</p>
<p>Why LRT? Not for transportation. It will be slower than buses. No, it is to revitalize the uptown, in which every previous attempt has failed. And to raise property value, so that more tax can be collected. Buses apparently won&#8217;t do that. <a href="http://observerxtra.com/2/news/region-prepares-to-gamble-your-money-on-lrt-experiment/">Of course this is all just a gamble</a>.</p>
<p>Light Rail Transit if merely the flavour of the week &#8211; just like roundabouts, nodes and corridors, and road diets. All ideas are new and hot for urban planners to try, and then discard when they fail. No problem at all, except for the massive waste of taxpayer dollars.<br />
Kevin Libin at the National Post <a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/04/01/kevin-libin-the-high-cost-of-calgarys-low-cost-transit/">demonstrates some of the folly of Light Rail Transit</a> using the oft-touted Calgary LRT. We are frequently told that LRT will eliminate the cost of building roads:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Furthermore, despite the dreams of transit planners, the system hasn’t actually gotten people to give up their cars: more people still drive downtown in Calgary than in any other Canadian city. And most transit riders, as everyone who lives here knows, simply drive to and park for free at the LRT stations and then ride the train downtown, rather than pay the $22 median “early bird” daily parking rates in the central business district. <strong>The LRT certainly hasn’t saved Calgary the pain of road building costs</strong>: the city spends the most in Canada per capita laying asphalt, 25% more than its closest rival, Edmonton, the study reveals.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And we&#8217;re told that LRT if far preferable to more flexible Bus Rapid Transit:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Bus Rapid Transit is essentially industry jargon for express buses, but has fallen out of favour with municipal politicians. The reasons, Lafleur believes, is because higher levels of government often pick up the bill for train infrastructure, letting municipal politicians “trade off higher capital costs for lower operating costs, even if the total cost is higher” and because cities often overlook, as Calgary has, the hidden costs of light rail. I think it’s just because mayors like choo-choo trains — or at least, as Lafleur points out, so many are intoxicated by visions of urban-hip “transit oriented development” built around LRT stations. These trendy communities result in higher property values, which work out nicely for city tax departments and high-income workers (the ones lucky enough to have parking spots provided for them downtown), but not so well for low-income workers, who are the ones most likely to benefit directly from transit.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It is fairly evident at this point that all information promoting the LRT is so biased as to be completely unusable in making a serious decision about transit options in Waterloo. Is it that difficult for Regional staff and politicians to actually speak honestly about transit?</p>
<p>However, my favorite line is that one that we need the LRT to attract skilled workers. How did we manage to attract the skilled workers that already live here without the LRT?</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs needs someone to run the Facebook page for the Dept. of the Interior and they’ll pay up to $115,000 a year.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jamie Murai <a href="http://blog.jamiemurai.com/2011/02/you-win-rim/">wrote a post</a> about the pain of writing applications for RIM devices. He did what I and so many others couldn&#8217;t; he got a response from RIM.</p>
<p>Not that this really matters. As I&#8217;ve noted before, RIM&#8217;s developer tools are difficult to use and don&#8217;t really work all that well. I was porting one of my applications to the BlackBerry, but set it aside when somebody at RIM informed me that barcode scanning did not work properly on the Torch, something they knew when they shipped it. This is not a company that has any regard for developers, or customers seemingly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just impressed that he got them to acknowledge him. I can only assume that is a result of him hitting then with Playbook issues just as they are perhaps nearing the launch of that device.</p>
<p>When I first heard of the Playbook I assumed they would run Android, and I certainly hope that they do<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/05/rim-finally-sees-the-light-unfortunately-its-an-onrushing-train-or-is-it/"> as seems to be the prevailing belief</a>. Because otherwise the Playbook is pretty much a tablet that plays Flash apps (I mean Adobe AIR apps), and some media.</p>
<p>But hey, I doubt they&#8217;ll be reading this anyway. I&#8217;m just an application developer. What do I know?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that the climate change scam&#8230; errr, story&#8230; has managed to drag on this long in the face of so much opposing evidence, but P.T. Barnum did say that there was a sucker born every minute. <a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/i_dont_think_the_warmists_models_are_working/">But perhaps we&#8217;re nearing the end:</a><br />
<blockquote><i>Britain&#8217;s warmists in 2000 predict the end of snow: </i><br />
<blockquote><i>Britain&#8217;s winter ends tomorrow with further indications of a striking environmental change: snow is starting to disappear from our lives. </i>
<p><i>Sledges, snowmen, snowballs and the excitement of waking to find that the stuff has settled outside are all a rapidly diminishing part of Britain&#8217;s culture, as warmer winters &#8211; which scientists are attributing to global climate change &#8211; produce not only fewer white Christmases, but fewer white Januaries and Februaries&#8230; </i></p>
<p><i>According to Dr David Viner, a senior research scientist at the climatic research unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia,within a few years winter snowfall will become &#8220;a very rare and exciting event&#8221;. </i></p>
<p>&#8221;Children just aren&#8217;t going to know what snow is,&#8221; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>But Britain in 2010: </i></p>
<blockquote><p><i>Afterweeks of chaos caused by snow, ice and Arctic temperatures, weather men are predicting rain, rain and more drizzle until January&#8230; </i>
<p><i>For the second winter running, a severe month-long big freeze has cost the economy billions and thisDecember is expected to be the chilliest since records began 100 years ago.</i></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Read <a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/i_dont_think_the_warmists_models_are_working/">the whole thing</a>. It would be funny if it wasn&#8217;t so sad.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Free speech <a href="http://takebackyourschool.wordpress.com/2010/11/14/christie-blatchford/">has apparently ceased to exist</a> at the University of Waterloo:<br />
<blockquote><i>Wilfred Laurier (sorry, my bad) University of Waterloo is the latest school to fall victim to these self-proclaimed activists. Christie Blatchford was set to give a talk to a small but enthusiastic crowd of people about her new book, Helpless: Caledonia&#8217;s Nightmare of Fear and Anarchy, and How the Law Failed All of Us. </i>
<p><i>[...] They stormed in, put up a huge sign with a swastika on stage, locked arms, and refused to leave. They yelled and screamed at the audience and accused them all of being racists who weren&#8217;t welcome on &#8220;their&#8221; campus. When one man tried to ask them exactly what they wanted, the heavy-set female in filthy jeans exclaimed that she would not engage in discussion with &#8220;Nazis&#8221;. </i></p>

<p align="left">My alma mater. As you can imagine, I am soooo proud.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that Canada is fast becoming a country where free speech no longer exists, and only the &quot;right&quot; opinions are tolerated by those who know what is good for the rest of us. I remember when I started reading Ayn Rand novels and my parents told me that Canada would never be like that. Apparently things change.</p>
