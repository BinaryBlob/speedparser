It&#8217;s an absolutely wonderful book for teaching about the subject of &#8220;personal space&#8221; that&#8217;s often quite difficult for kids to understand. J frequently struggles (obliviously) with this, and <em>we</em> struggle to find a way to explain personal space to her. This book is brilliant.</p>
<p>Louis is the main character of the book, and he is a self-proclaimed &#8220;space expert&#8221; who has some big problems with personal space. Here&#8217;s an exerpt from the book:</p>
<p><em>The other day on the playground, I was showing Rusty how comets sometimes smash right into satellites. I was the comet. Rusty was the satellite. When we smashed, the playground teacher used her <strong>cranky</strong> voice. &#8216;Louis!&#8217; she said. &#8216;You have a problem with your personal space!&#8217;</em></p>
<p>After several encounters like this, Louis is sent to the principal&#8217;s office to attend Personal Space Camp. Louis is excited because he loves anything that has to do with space, but he soon realizes that this Space Camp is not about lunar explorations or meteorites. The principal teaches the kids attending about personal space in very creative and understandable ways. Our favorite was her hula hoop example, where she had each child sit and stand inside a hula hoop to represent their own personal space. J has been very interested in hula hoops lately (we have 3), so this example really resonated with her. At one point the principal puts several people inside one hula hoop and asks if they like the way it feels and if they can be &#8220;good pilots.&#8221; They all say they don&#8217;t like it and that they barely have space to move.</p>
<p>The principal goes on to explain personal space in additional creative ways that are very easy for young children to understand. J definitely had a better grasp of personal space by the time we were finished reading it. The illustrations are marvelous, colorful and engaging, the writing is humorous and down-to-earth in a style that easily connects with kids, and the message of respecting the physical boundaries of others is brilliantly delivered.</p>
<p>Probably best suited for kids 4-8</p>
<p>For further teaching, including corresponding activities for kids, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1931636931?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1931636931">Personal Space Camp Activity and Idea Book</a> is also available!</p>

Walking a  labyrinth is said to calm and inspire confidence, but tracing the path of a labyrinth with your finger or a tool can serve the same purpose. One <a href="http://www.isabellacatalog.com/p/Chartres-Labyrinth-Dish.cfm?tid=709091718">source</a> I found claims: &#8220;It holds a quiet, safe place for the intuitive, symbolic mind to come forth and be more present than it may ever get a chance to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>No matter what, I figure it&#8217;s fun (J LOVES mazes), and it promotes focus &amp; fine motor skills. Win! J <em>does</em> seem to calm when she&#8217;s doing this, so that&#8217;s an added bonus! Finally, it&#8217;s a great quiet activity for restaurants, doctor&#8217;s offices, etc. that&#8217;s easy to slip into a bag or purse.</p>
<p>The one we have (pictured above) is a replica of the <a href="http://www.labyrinthos.net/chartresfaq.html">walking labyrinth in Chartres Cathedral</a> in France that was built around 1200! I&#8217;d love to visit someday to walk the real thing.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in San Francisco, you can walk a real labyrinth <a href="http://www.gracecathedral.org/visit/labyrinth/index.php#Instructions">here</a>! You can also print out a paper finger labyrinth for free at <a href="http://www.lessons4living.com/finger_labyrinth.htm" target="_blank">Lessons 4 Living</a>.</p>

<p>We have a lot of experience with doctor visits, so here are some tips that we&#8217;ve learned the hard way.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><strong>Try to schedule first thing in the morning </strong>or right after the lunch break. The doctor will (hopefully) still be on schedule, you’ll have shorter waiting times, and there will (usually) be fewer people in the waiting room sneezing and coughing all over you.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>Dress your child in clothes that are easy to remove</strong>. Nuff said.</li>
<li><strong>Bring another adult whenever possible</strong>. I know &#8211; hard to do. If my husband can&#8217;t come, I sometimes call up my sister or aunt who live close by. It&#8217;s a lot easier to listen to the doctor and ask questions when there&#8217;s someone else there to help with your child.</li>
<li><strong>Bring a favorite blanket</strong>. Ask to lay it down on that cold scale they insist on laying a naked baby on. They can weigh the blanket first and subtract its weight from your baby’s. It’s also handy for covering the crinkly paper on the exam table, snuggling with, and for covering them up while you’re waiting for the doc. We ALWAYS take a blanket for x-rays of any kind. Those tables are COLD metal and I&#8217;ve asked for a sheet or blanket before and been told somewhat gruffly that they&#8217;re not available.</li>
<li><strong>Bring a change of clothes for child AND YOU</strong>. You can leave them in the car, but nobody wants to drive home wearing surprise vomit.</li>
<li><strong>Bring something to catch said “surprise vomit</strong>.” We always carry two extra cloth diapers and a plastic bag, which wads up nicely in a corner of the diaper bag.</li>
<li><strong>Bring crayons for coloring on exam table paper</strong>.  This is the one thing that helped J to not be afraid of getting on the crinkly sounding/feeling paper.</li>
<li><strong>Take a favorite stuffed animal or doll</strong>.  Have the nurse and/or doctor do &#8220;scary&#8221; procedures on special buddy first.</li>
<li><strong>If your child has specific aversions, sensory issues or fears</strong>, explain them fully to the nurse who talks to you before the doctor comes in. Be prepared to offer an alternative if possible. For example, J absolutely FREAKS with anything sticky on her skin, like a bandaid. When we go for any kind of injections or lab work, I explain this up front &amp; provide my own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TBQJ50?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B000TBQJ50">med wrap</a> that I bring along if they need it. If your child HATES having their ears or nose looked, or something similar that simply can&#8217;t be avoided, still be sure to explain it to the nurse ahead of time. It helps them be prepared and possibly to do it more quickly and/or gently.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for </strong><a href="http://sweetease.respironics.com/"><strong>Sweet-Ease</strong></a><strong> before shots or blood work</strong>.  Or you could bring your own in a medicine syringe.  This is simply sugar water, but we learned the trick from NICU nurses.  It calms and soothes due to an endorphin release.  Drug-free soothing.  Sweet (ha!)</li>
<li><strong>Ask to hold your child for procedures</strong>.  J does a lot better with staying calm when she sits on my lap facing outward with my arms around her.  This works great for BP, blood work, shots, checking ears/nose/throat &#8211; - just about anything.</li>
<li><strong>Buy a toy doctor kit and &#8220;practice&#8221; at home beforehand</strong>.  This has worked wonders for us.  Try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AO2260?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B001AO2260">Parents Little MD</a> in carrying case ($29) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NK643Q?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B003NK643Q">Usborne&#8217;s &#8220;Going to the Doctor&#8221; kid kit</a>,  which comes with a book ($12).  We used the Usborne kit and book. Talk about what they can expect. When J had to have a CT scan, we practiced laying very still with a timer set for 3 minutes. She thought it was a fun game, PLUS she wanted to avoid IV sedation at all costs because she IS TERRIFIED OF &#8220;pokes.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Ask for a lab technician who specializes in pediatrics.</strong> I learned the hard way to INSIST on this when J needs blood work. A friend learned the hard way when her 2yo daughter needed a catheter placed. There is a WORLD of difference between J getting blood drawn at our local hospital lab or at the Children&#8217;s Hospital. Someone who specializes in children simply does it faster and better.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for skin anesthetic to numb skin before IVs or blood work</strong>.  This is simply a lotion or gel that&#8217;s applied to the skin to numb it.  We didn&#8217;t even know this was an option until they just DID it in the ER for us.  Maybe not a necessity for everyone (maybe not always available?), but any pokes have been super-traumatic for Jenna and have almost always led to vomiting.  We&#8217;re up for anything to avoid that scenario. <em>From Dr. Sears:  Apparently this cream is available over-the-counter, but is somewhat expensive.  He recommends that, if you buy it, you wait to apply it until at the doctor&#8217;s office so the nurse can show you where to put it (or you&#8217;ll be numbing the wrong spot).  He says he&#8217;s not sure it&#8217;s worth the cost and trouble and suggests simply firmly rubbing the injection site for a few minutes before the injection.  He also says that breastfeeding during shots or bloodwork has been shown to decrease discomfort in babies!!</em></li>
<li><strong>If you can&#8217;t get a topical anesthetic: </strong>bring an ice pack or request one! A brief application of ice beforehand numbs the area nicely, as well. We&#8217;ve been known to bring an ice pack in an insulated lunch tote just for this purpose! Also, once J got used to having the topical anesthetic, she INSISTED that she needed it (some psychological dependence). When we ran into places that didn&#8217;t provide or allow it, I whipped out my own &#8220;Magic Cream&#8221; which was actually hand sanitizer in a plain, unmarked container. The placebo effect truly works wonders.</li>
<li><strong>During injections or blood work</strong>: J tends to hyperventilate due to her extreme needle phobia (we&#8217;ve had a lot of bad experiences, yo), so we&#8217;ve learned a few tricks that help avoid that as well as helping to calm her. We bring a harmonica. This requires her to breathe in and out more slowly and also means she can&#8217;t scream. In the absence of a harmonica, an easy &#8220;trick&#8221; is to hold up four fingers and tell her they&#8217;re candles on a birthday cake. Ask her to blow them out (blow hard!), one by one. If you still need to stall for time, tell her one (or three) didn&#8217;t go out and she needs to try again.</li>
<li><strong>DON&#8217;T BE AFRAID TO BE ASSERTIVE</strong>! I&#8217;ve learned this the hard way, which is why J now has a needle phobia and why I now INSIST on a pediatric specialist. The medical professionals want to help your child, but they also want to get their job done so they can move on to the next patient. They have a job to do. But so do we. We are the only advocate our child has. We are their voice. If we need to insist on special arrangements for our child, we can and should do it. Politely (and within reason), of course.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask questions</strong>. When J was hospitalized with pneumonia at 2, a nurse came in &amp; somewhat hesitantly said that the doctor wanted to do a catheter to test for a UTI. She looked me in the eye and very distinctly said, &#8220;You have the right to refuse this test.&#8221; In the fog of everything going on, I wasn&#8217;t thinking at my bestest. I asked if the doctor thought it was necessary, and, hesitantly again, she carefully stated that he wanted to rule out a UTI possibility. I ended up saying that if the doctor was asking for it, they could do it. During the procedure (which was NOT fun for anyone), I said to the nurse, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it possible that you&#8217;re INTRODUCING a UTI or creating a problem by inserting the cath?&#8221; and she seemed relieved/exasperated and responded, &#8220;THAT&#8217;S why I told you you have the right to refuse the test.&#8221; Sure enough, J tested negative, but ended up having all kinds of pain and problems with urination and developed a UTI soon after. From a procedure she really didn&#8217;t need to have (we had already confirmed pneumonia with a chest x-ray, blood work, etc.), but that I didn&#8217;t ask enough questions about. Learn from my mistake.</li>

<p>To build our own sensory box, I simply started with a standard <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OPT8TK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000OPT8TK">plastic storage bin</a> and filled it with an assortment of inexpensive (mostly dollar store) items of interesting and varying textures. Now, I simply add new items I find while shopping or working around the house, and sometimes, J and I find items together outside that we add to the sensory box (I always have final veto/approval power, because J would insist on bringing in bugs, slugs, etc. otherwise). J has access to the box whenever she likes, but we sometimes have structured and guided times when I sit down with her and encourage touching EVERYTHING. If we didn&#8217;t do this, there would simply always be certain textures that J would completely avoid.</p>
<p>Pictured in my bin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feathers</li>
<li>Red dog squeaky toy (silky, furry &amp; squeaky)</li>
<li>Feather duster</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9BKVS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000V9BKVS">Koosh ball</a></li>
<li>Misc. stress relief squeezers (red smiley is sand filled w/silly, stringy/stretchy hair, yellow ball is super soft, &amp; skunk is more firm)</li>
<li>Stretchy, gummy worms</li>
<li>Kitchen sponge/scratcher combo</li>
<li>Pot scrubber</li>
<li>Bumpy, light-up ball</li>
</ul>
<p>Other items we have included in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nuts, bolts, washers from garage</li>
<li>Rubber bands</li>
<li>Jiggly/vibrating toys</li>
<li>Acorns</li>
<li>Sea glass</li>
<li>River rocks</li>
<li>Stones</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00291RPB0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00291RPB0">Slime</a></li>
<li>Buttons</li>
<li>Pipe cleaners</li>
<li>Mini bean bags</li>
<li>Fabric remnant pieces (corduroy, fleece, flannel, burlap, etc.)</li>
<li>Beans</li>
<li>Pine cones</li>
<li>Silk scarf</li>
<li>Sea shells</li>
<li>Springs</li>
<li>Quarters</li>
<li>Sand paper</li>
<li>Teethers</li>
</ul>
<p>The list is really only limited by your imagination! Look around your pantry, your garage, your cupboards &amp; your yard. Textures are everywhere. For more ideas, you can check out Montessori sites, like <a href="http://countingcoconuts.blogspot.com/">Counting Coconuts</a>, that feature ideas for monthly or weekly sensory tubs like <a href="http://countingcoconuts.blogspot.com/2011/05/robot-sensory-tub.html">this one</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>Vestibular sensations determine our sense of balance, our orientation to gravity and our body&#8217;s movement through space. The structures in the ear not responsible for hearing make up the vestibular system. The vestibular system helps us maintain our equilibrium while we spin, rock, sway or bend. Vestibular input can be calming or alerting. Usually, performing activities in a high energy way will rev us up and doing them in a slow, rhythmical way will calm us down. Most people need around 5 minutes of continuous activity like this to effect their nervous system in a positive way. Vestibular activities have also been tied to language development, and children will often talk more after lots of input. You may also notice an increase in eye contact and attentiveness after performing these activities. Here&#8217;s a list of suggested activities we were given by our therapist:</p>
<p>*note: all activities can be performed with or without low lights &amp; soft, slow, rhythmic music</p>
<ul>
<li>Gently swing in a hammock</li>
<li>Rock slowly &amp; rhythmically in a chair, glider or porch swing</li>
<li>While sitting, rock side to side while bear-hugging child</li>
<li>Gently roll while wrapped in a blanket that was warmed in the dryer</li>
<li>Lay prone (on stomach) on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XKKBCO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000XKKBCO">therapy ball</a> and gently roll/rock forward &amp; back or side to side</li>
<li>Lay prone on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RPS87E/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001RPS87E">scooter board</a> and gently roll forward &amp; back</li>
<li>Slowly tilt glitter sticks/batons back &amp; forth in hands</li>
<li>Slowly roll <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001T6QH9M/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001T6QH9M">glitter ball</a> back and forth from hand to hand</li>
<li>Slowly tilt <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040BAGLS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0040BAGLS">rain stick</a> back and forth</li>
<li>Watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWSVLK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001MWSVLK">lava lamp</a>, fish tank or similar in a darkened room</li>
</ul>
<p>Always pay attention to your child&#8217;s responses and behavior. Verbal kids can tell you whether or not they like something. Behavioral cues will tell YOU whether they are calming, getting revved up, or getting irritated/afraid. A tense of fearful child isn&#8217;t calming and you should try a different activity. If your child seems to be revving up, make sure the movements are slow and rhythmic, and if they are, don&#8217;t get discouraged, just try something else.</p>
<p>Jenna especially loves our glider/rocker, a hammock, side-to-side bear-hug rocking, rolling her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001T6QH9M/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001T6QH9M">glitter ball</a>, and watching her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042RU31I/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0042RU31I">Mobi Tykelight</a> in the dark. Because she loves the &#8220;hugging&#8221; feeling of a hammock so much (we don&#8217;t have one of our own) we&#8217;ve added the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L67C02/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=psysho-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002L67C02">HowdaHUGs</a>™ chair to her wishlist.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31oiKTuPHaL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="210" />The HowdaHUGs™ cradles and rocks while supporting the upper body. The slats are made of basswood and are water/stain resistant and the side straps are adjustable for a snug or loose fit. What a great way to help calm during reading or quiet times!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you have additional ideas for calming, please leave them in the comments!</p>
