		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alaskaaces.com.ph/alaska%e2%80%99s-williams-a-lot-like-simpson-836.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://www.alaskaaces.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ldwilliams02102011.jpg' alt='alaska' />The campaign of the Alaska Aces to defend their Philippine Basketball Association Fiesta Cup championship went into high gear with the arrival of import LD Williams.</p>
<p>Williams officially passed the PBA height test, coming in at 6 feet 3 1/6th of an inch, and is practicing regularly with the team at the Reyes Gym in Mandaluyong. Many observers remarked that Williams reminded them of Diamon Simpson who led the team to the 2010 PBA Fiesta Cup championship.</p>
<p>“He does have some similarities to Diamon: the same age, only 22; raw still in his skills, great personality and very respectful; and brings something unique to the table athletically (Diamon with his long arms and LD with his amazing hops).  We&#8217;re just hoping LD can bring us the same result as Diamon,” said Alaska coach Tim Cone.</p>
<p>Williams finished his career as one of the top defenders in Wake Forest history. He is the only player to earn multiple ACC All-Defensive Team awards, earning the honor in 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p>He was a starter from his rookie season to his graduation starting in 118 of 119 career games. He ranks fifth all-time at Wake Forest in career starts. He also ranks 11th at Wake Forest with 136 career steals. He finished with 1,005 career points, achieving the milestone in his final collegiate game. He was also team captain in the last three years of his stay in the school.</p>
<p>Williams is a spectacular leaper and placed fourth in the 2010 College Slam Dunk Contest. He is a reliable shooter who could easily knock down medium-range jumpers.</p>
<p>“LD has been an exciting acquisition for us,” said Coach Tim. “The Alaska (and PBA) fans are going to love him.  We&#8217;ve never had a high-flyer like him before.  It will be fun from a coaching point of view to see how exactly we can get the most out of him.  Exploring his many skills in the triangle will be our favorite past-time for the next few weeks.”</p>
<p>The Alaska mentor however emphasized that their original import choice Eddie Basden was a big loss to the team.</p>
<p>Basden had already led the Aces to a championship after the team ruled the mini-tournament the Cebu City Mayor’s Cup participated in by the Meralco Bolts, the Powerade Tigers and the Cebuana Lhuillier Kuwarta Padala Niños.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t want to downplay the loss of Eddie Basden,” said Coach Tim. “We really liked Eddie and we were crushed when he failed the height measurement.  He was an excellent player and an excellent person and teammate.  He was a bad loss for us and we wish him the best.”</p>
<p>Basden was disallowed by the PBA from playing in the upcoming PBA Fiesta Cup after he exceeded the height limit of 6 feet 4 inches by a miniscule 1/4th of an inch. Basden was measured to be 6’4 1/4” of an inch tall.</p>
<p>In a related development Coach Tim announced that the Aces released Marvin Hayes and signed up Don Dulay.</p>
<p>Dulay was born October 17, 1980 in Los Angeles, California. He played for the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters. Dulay applied for the 2006 PBA Draft but no teams drafted him. He was signed by the Welcoat Dragons, later named Rain or Shine, as a free agent in the 2007-08 PBA season.</p>
<p>Dulay is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 150 lbs. He is a product of El Camino College a two-year public community college located partially in Alondra Park and partially in the City of Torrance in Los Angeles County, California, United States.</p>
<p>Dulay had his best game ever in the PBA playing against the Alaska Aces. Dulay led the Elasto Painters to a come-from-behind victory over Alaska, 81-86, in the PBA Philippine Cup at the Antipolo Ynares Center, Nov. 13, 2009.</p>
<p>The loss snapped the Aces’ six-game winning streak but their record (6 wins, one loss) still left them alone on top of the standings.</p>
<p>Trailing Alaska then were the Barangay Ginebra Gin Kings (4-1), the San Miguel Beermen (5-2), the Talk n Text Tropang Texters (4-2), the Purefoods Tender Juicy Giants (3-3), the Sta. Lucia Realtors (3-3), the Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2-4), the Coca-Cola Tigers (1-4), the Burger King Whoppers (1-4) and Rain or Shine (1-6).</p>
<p>The Elasto Painters came into the game with a six-game losing streak against the Aces’ six-game winning streak.</p>
<p>The Aces were leading by 12 points late in the third when Dulay exploded like a bomb to lead his team to victory.</p>
<p>Dulay converted almost every field goal attempt he threw up, scoring 20 points in a span of a little over 12 minutes which started at the tail end of the third period. Dulay scored on a layup to cut the Alaska lead to 10 points, 61-51, to end the third period. He then torched the Aces for 18 fourth-quarter points.</p>
<p>Dulay even scored the crucial points which led to the Alaska defeat. With the Aces trailing by only two points, 76-78, with 1:20 left in the game Dulay drained a triple, converted two free throws, then scored on a layup to seal the win for Rain or Shine, 76-85, with just 34 seconds to go.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alaskaaces.com.ph/alaska-aces-out-to-tame-tigers-833.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://www.alaskaaces.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/alaskasmall.jpg' alt='alaska' /> The Alaska Aces will be looking to tame the Powerade Tigers on Wednesday and book a best-of-three quarterfinal duel against either the Barangay Ginebra Gin Kings or the BMEG Derby Ace Llamados.</p>
<p>The Aces (6 wins, 7 losses) meet the Tigers (3-10) in the opening 5 p.m. game of the 2010-2011 Philippine Basketball Association Philippine Cup at the Araneta Coliseum.</p>
<p>The biggest concern of Alaska coach Tim Cone is the perennial fourth quarter collapse which has hounded the Aces in their past few games.</p>
<p>“My best description is Deer in the headlights,” said coach Tim. “They (Alaska players) look at the headlights of an oncoming vehicle and can’t move. They know what’s coming but they can’t do anything about it and still get hit. We have worked hard all these weeks but still couldn’t change our reactions.”</p>
<p>The game Wednesday decides the all-important placing of the Aces in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>A victory sends the Aces to a best-of-three quarterfinal duel against the Gin Kings (10-4) or the Llamados (7-7). A loss sends Alaska to a tiebreak with the Meralco Bolts (6-7), the Air Express (6-8) and/or the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters (5-8).</p>
<p>This means, that if they lose on Wednesday, depending on their quotient the Aces could possibly wind up facing the league-leading Talk n Text Tropang Texters (11-3) or the San Miguel Beermen (11-3) with the Aces handicapped with a twice-to-win disadvantage (where Alaska will have to win twice while Talk n Text or San Miguel need only win once to advance).</p>
<p>To avoid any complications the Aces will need to follow up their swashbuckling 92-89 victory over the San Miguel Beermen last Sunday at the Araneta Coliseum.</p>
<p>With the score tied at 89-all and with just five seconds left in the game, LA Tenorio dribbled the length of the court then banked in a triple over the outstretched hands of a defending Alex Cabagnot to push the Aces to victory.</p>
<p>“Kudos to LA (Tenorio). He showed his big heart and he kept playing hard the whole time. Last time we played them, it was Cabagnot who won it for them at the buzzer and this time it’s LA,” said coach Tim.</p>
<p>Before the winning play, Dondon Hontiveros tied the game at 89-all with a triple of his own with 5.6 ticks remaining.</p>
<p>The win snapped the Aces’ two-game slide and pushed them to a 6-7 record.</p>
<p>Joe Devance scored a game-high of 28 points (22 in the first half), seven rebounds and three assists but was limited to only six in the second half where Alaska’s offense struggled after a spectacular first half.</p>
<p>The game on Wednesday between Alaska and Powerade will actually be no-bearing for the Tigers who, along with the Barako Bull Energy Boosters (3-11), have already been formally eliminated.</p>
<p>But Barako Bull posted a face-saving 85-83 shock victory over BMEG in its last game last Friday. No doubt the Tigers will similarly want to go out this conference on a winning note.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alaskaaces.com.ph/aces-beat-up-barako-bull-830.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://www.alaskaaces.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/tenorio_8639_in.jpg' alt='tenorio_8639_in.jpg' /> The Alaska Aces overcame a sluggish start and woke up in time to subdue the<br />
Barako Bull Energy Boosters, 88-64, in the 2010-2011 Philippine Basketball<br />
Association Philippine Cup at the Araneta Coliseum last Friday.</p>
<p>Barako Bull virtually ambushed the Aces at the start posting a 10-0 lead in the<br />
first four minutes of the game and eventually erecting their biggest lead of 12<br />
points, 27-15, with 7:07 to go in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The Aces finally played with a sense of urgency late in the second quarter and<br />
then went on to post the victory pulling away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was certainly frustrating at the start,&#8221; said Alaska coach Tim Cone. &#8220;We<br />
expected the bad start because we didn&#8217;t have enough practice. But we didn&#8217;t<br />
expect it to be that bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Aces went on a vacation to Disneyland as reward for winning the 2010 PBA<br />
Fiesta Conference. Coach Tim admitted in numerous interviews that he felt Alaska<br />
was behind the other teams in terms of preparation for the 36th PBA season.</p>
<p>Joe Devance led the Alaska uprising late in the second period with the Aces<br />
trailing 22-32 at the three-minute mark. Devance buried back-to-back triples to<br />
cut the Barako lead to only four points, 28-32.</p>
<p>Alaska would then go on to score a 7-2 run capped by an LA Tenorio triple to<br />
snatch the lead for the first time and go to the lockers with a 35-34 halftime<br />
lead.</p>
<p>The Aces went to town in the third period, outscoring Barako Bull, 29-16, to<br />
virtually put away the game as early as the end of the third period, 64-50.</p>
<p>Coach Tim said he was glad to start the season on a winning note by prevailing<br />
in their first game.<br />
&#8220;We wanted to focus on the idea of how well we were playing regardless of who we<br />
were playing against,&#8221; </p>
<p>said coach Tim. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t matter whether we were playing San Miguel, or the LA<br />
Lakers or somebody&#8217;s grand mother. We wanted to be always playing our best no<br />
matter what.&#8221;</p>
<p>Devance scored a team-high 24 points to go with a team-high 12 rebounds. He also<br />
had five assists and one block.</p>
<p>LA Tenorio added 18 markers to go with seven rebounds, three assists, one steal<br />
and one block.<br />
Cyrus Baguio had a team-high 10 assists. He also scored 11 points, grabbed six<br />
rebounds and had one steal.</p>
<p>Sonny Thoss scored 11 points. He also had seven rebounds and one assist.</p>
<p>Bonbon Cuistodio had nine points, three rebounds, two assists, one steal and one<br />
block.</p>
<p>Team captain Tony Dela Cruz had eight points, four rebounds, three assists, two<br />
blocks and one steal.</p>
<p>Ervin Sotto scored six points and grabbed one rebound in just two minutes of<br />
action.</p>
<p>Sam Eman had six rebounds, one point, one block and one assist.</p>
<p>Mark Borboran had four rebounds and one steal.</p>
<p>Elmer Espiritu had three rebounds and one steal.</p>
<p>The scores:</p>
<p>Alaska Aces 88 - Joe Devance 24, LA Tenorio 18, Sonny Thoss 11, Cyrus Baguio 11,<br />
Bonbon Custodio 9, Tony Dela Cruz 8, Ervin Sotto 6, Sam Eman 1, Elmer Espiritu<br />
0, Mark Borboran 0.</p>
<p>Barako Bull 64 - Sunday Salvacion 22, Mark Isip 14, Hans Thiele 12, Rob<br />
Wainwright 5, Reed Juntilla 4, Chad Alonzo 2, Mark Andaya 2, Paolo Hubalde 2,<br />
Marvin Cruz 1, Jojo Duncil 0, Aris Dimaunahan 0.</p>
<p>Quarter scores: 14-18, 35-34, 64-50, 88-64</p>

<p>Past and present players of the Alaska Aces are all looking forward to the 25th Anniversary Grand Reunion on Sep. 28 which formally kicks off the year-long celebration of the Alaska Aces&#8217; pursuit of excellence and success in the Philippine Basketball Association.</p>
<p>The event also serves as occasion for members of the Alaska organization to reminisce and remember the best of times with the team.</p>
<p>Former resident import Sean Chambers says his most cherished memories were about the Grand Slam in 1996 when Alaska won all three PBA titles up for grabs.</p>
<p>The Grand Slam was the best, said Chambers. Many did not know it but I suffered a serious ankle injury after Game 2 in the 3rd conference final and we still won.</p>
<p>The former Alaska import also recalled with fondness winning his first PBA title in 1991 against Ginebra.</p>
<p>Anytime you beat a (Robert) Jaworski team is a big deal, said Chambers. I would say that was the most rewarding. We were young. We beat the Ginebra team of former Los Angeles Lakers Wes Matthews.</p>
<p>The Alaska-Ginebra rivalry was at its height at the time. Alaska won its share of titles with Chambers returning regularly to power the Aces. He developed close ties with his teammates and the Alaska management and staff.</p>
<p>Every teammate I played with treated me as a brother or family member, said Chambers. It was an honor for me to be accepted in this manner by my Pinoy teammates. Abet Guidaben started the trend of treating me as one their own. I love Abet.</p>
<p>Chambers played as an import for Alaska for a record number of 11 years. He is now a vice-principal at a middle school in Sacramento.</p>

<p>In observance of their winning tradition the Alaska Aces launch the year-long celebration of their 25th anniversary when they hold the Alaska Aces 25th Anniversary Grand Reunion on Sep. 28.</p>
<p>The event formally starts the celebration of the Alaska Aces&#8217; pursuit of excellence and success in the Philippine Basketball Association.</p>
<p>All past and present Alaska players, coaching staff and managers are invited to the grand reunion. Sean Chambers, Ponky Alolor, Ricky Relosa, Dennis Abatuan, Tim Coloso and Naning Valenciano - who are all based in the US - have confirmed their participation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make it happen. I love Alaska . I can&#8217;t wait. I am super excited,&#8221; said Chambers in a published report. </p>
<p>Chambers played as an import for Alaska for a record number of 11 years. He first gained prominence after beating Billy Ray Bates in a slam-dunk contest as a member of a visiting All-Star team. Chambers is now a vice-principal at a middle school in Sacramento .</p>
<p>Longtime Alaska Aces fan and supporter Gary Valenciano will perform as well.</p>
<p>A total of 117 local players and 35 imports have donned the Alaska Aces, Alaska Milk or Hills Bros jersey. Teddy Alfarero and Arnie Tuadles have passed away.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s initial draft pick was Rey Cuenco, who later became more popular as having played for Ginebra.</p>
<p>Alaska was the first PBA team to retire player jerseys and hand out championships rings. Other players who have had their jerseys retired are Bogs Adornado, Chambers, assistant coach Jojo Lastimosa and most recently, Jeff Cariaso.</p>
<p>The year-long celebration comes on the heels of the Aces winning the 2010 Fiesta Conference title which is their 13th title in 24 years of participation in the PBA.</p>
<p>The Aces have advanced to 25 championships in 24 years of competition in the league. They have won six Governors&#8217; Cup titles, three All-Filipino Cup, two Commissioner&#8217;s Cup and two Fiesta Conference championships.</p>

<p>Teams in the Philippine Basketball Association have adopted different systems with varying degrees of success. But the Alaska Aces have stuck to their tried and tested system which recently yielded their 13th PBA title in 24 years.</p>
<p>It is no secret that the Aces under coach Tim Cone have always relied on the triangle offense in all these years of participation in the league.</p>
<p>Actually wala kaming bagong ginawa, said point guard LA Tenorio. Triangle last year, two years ago, three years ago. From the time I joined the team iyon pa din ang ginagawa namin. </p>
<p>This is because the triangle offense virtually has unlimited options available to the offensive team depending on how the defense reacts.</p>
<p>Madami talagang option iyong triangle, said Tenorio. Iyong mga option kasi ng triangle, nagrereact lang kami sa binibigay ng defense. Iyon ang maganda sa triangle. Stop nila ang first option, meron pa kaming isa pa. May next option. May next option pa.</p>
<p>According to the Alaska guard the triangle has virtually limitless options and can react to anything the defense sets up.</p>
<p>Kaya medyo siguro hindi nila mabasa talaga iyong triangle, said Tenorio. Kaya sila nahihirapan. Kasi akala nila basta ibinibigay namin ang bola kay Diamon (Simpson) okay na. Pero there are different options. Madami talagang ginagawang option iyong triangle.</p>
<p>The Aces had to run through a virtual gauntlet before eventually winning the Fiesta Conference title. Their system served them in good stead.</p>
<p>Alaska outlasted the Barangay Ginebra Gin Kings in the full five games of the quarterfinals. They then survived the determined challenge of the Talk n Text Tropang Texters who extended the semifinals the full seven games. In the championship Alaska beat the heavily favored San Miguel Beermen in six games to win the title.</p>

<p>[Watch/listen to the live interview of newest Alaska Ace Bonbon Custodio who will be the guest of MBC Sports Center, 6 to 7 p.m., Sunday, Sep. 12, over dzRH radio, 666 on the AM band and on RHTV over Cignal TV and Cable Link.</p>
<p>The show can be followed live from anywhere in the world through the Internet on http://dzrh.tripod.com and http://dzrh.prepys.com.]</p>
<p>Alaska Aces General Manager Joaqui Trillo said the three players they acquired during the past Philippine Basketball Association Draft - Elmer Espiritu, Bonbon Custodio via a trade and Marvin Hayes - will definitely contribute and be a big help to the team.</p>
<p>Elmer is not that tall for a forward, said Trillo. He is only six foot three. But he has an amazing wingspan which is about six foot eight. He is quick. He can jump. He reminds me of our import Diamon Simpson.</p>
<p>The former University of the East star was signed to a three year, P8.7 million contract by the Aces effective Sep. 1, 2010 to Aug. 31, 2013. The deal for the fourth overall pick is the maximum allowable for a rookie.</p>
<p>Elmer has been a pleasant surprise, said Trillo. We like his attitude. He is very soft-spoken and I am sure he will be a great fit with the team. </p>
<p>Espiritu played five seasons with the University of the East Red Warriors and led the team to a runner-up finish to the Ateneo De Manila University Blue Eagles in 2009 where he averaged 13.2 points, 7.8 rebounds and 2.6 blocks in almost 32 minutes of action per game.</p>
<p>In the Philippine Basketball League he played for the Cobra Energy Warriors and the Pharex Generix. He also helped the Philippine Patriots win the inaugural Asean Basketball League title. </p>
<p>Espiritu was the PBL-LIGA General Santos League MVP in 2010, Mythical 5 First Team in UAAP Season 72, Most Defensive Player UAAP Season 72, UAAP and NCAA Slamdunk Champion in 2008 and 2006, MVP of the 2008 FilOil Flying V Invitational Cup, Mythical 5 First Team of the 2008 FilOil Flying V Invitational Cup and Defensive Stopper PBL Silver Cup.</p>

<p>The Alaska Aces came away with a bountiful harvest from the Market, Market Activity Center last Sunday during the 2010 Philippine Basketball Association Draft plucking the most freakishly athletic player to come to the PBA in years in Elmer Espiritu, combo guard Bonbon Custodio and workhorse Marvin Hayes.</p>
<p>The six-foot-three inch Espiritu was born Nov. 23, 1985. He played five seasons for the University of the East Warriors from 2005 to 2009. He was captain of the UE team that finished second to the Ateneo De Manila University Blue Eagles in the 2009 UAAP season. </p>
<p>The Aces had to give up Larry Fonacier to the Talk n Text Tropang Texters to gain the fourth pick overall which they used on Espiritu.</p>
<p>It costs us Larry and it is going to hurt us a lot, said Alaska coach Tim Cone. He played a pivotal role in the championship series against San Miguel and was really coming into his own. But he became a victim of the salary cap. The good side is that he will join a Talk N Text squad where he can earn more and that he will be under the guidance of Chot Reyes, who is a good friend of mine. He promised to take care of Larry.</p>
<p>The Alaska mentor said it was difficult to give up Fonacier but said he welcomed the opportunity to develop Espiritu who could help the team.</p>
<p>Espiritu expressed delight at being able to play for a PBA champion team like Alaska.</p>
<p>Masaya ako na nakuha ako (sa PBA) and Alaska pa, said Espiritu. Hindi ko madescribe ang feeling. I will just do my best para makatulong sa team. Medyo may added pressure din sa akin joining a champion team like Alaska. But at the same time, it is a personal challenge for me. It is a good thing I have basic knowledge of the Triangle Offense because naging coach ko si Luigi Trillo sa PBL.</p>
